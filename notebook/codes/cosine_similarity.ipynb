       " \"I have a badger 5 it is leaking water at bottom near reset bottom plus does a new one came with a ss ring for inside the sink If your garbage disposal is leaking out the bottom near the reset button, you most likely have a leak in the metal plate that is located directly under the blades. This plate is designed to protect the electrically powered parts of the motor (the rotor, the shaft, etc.) from moisture, but it is rather thin and is only made of galvanized steel. After a year or two, especially if you use highly acidic cleaners which you rinse down your sink, the zinc layer will corrode and expose the steel, which will then also start to corrode, until something hard eventually pokes some kind of hole through the plate somewhere (could be somewhere very small), signaling the end of the machine's service life. The plate is not meant to be repaired, only replaced along with the rest of the unit. That water is getting through to your rotor is an electrical hazard, and should be dealt with immediately (by removing the damaged unit). The manufacturer has figured out that the blades need to me made of stainless steel, but has chosen to skimp on making other interior parts of this more-expensive metal. Good luck!. If no power cord is included, how do I plug in the disposal unit? I ttok mine off of the broken unit and installed it on the new one.. Can someone tell me if this Badger 5 disposer is simple to replace (with my old broken Badger 5)? (i.e. Can I do it myself vs. hiring a plumber ) I replaced my a couple of months ago, I'm semi-handy fixing a lot of small stuff around the house. I'm small and in my late seventies, the only problem was holding the unit up in place while turning the locking ring. I no longer have the upper body strength to do it so I used a stack of books. Made sure all the connections were tight and have had so problems since. It clean and in good shape so I left the old badger mount in the sink. Took about forty min, but a lot of that was getting the books.. Is this Badger 5 compatible with the Badger 5 model 5-81? Same size and fittings? It fit the same as the one we replaced. will this one work to replace the badger 1 1/3 HP Yes it will. The sink connector is even the same. so can this unit be connected with a dishwasher or do I need a different model? yes, I did it with mine.. How easy to replace existing badger 1 with badger 5? Not difficult as long as you have a helper or something to prop up the replacement as you screw it into place.. My present disposal has a 3 bolt connection. Would changing to the twist type connection for a new disposal make installation complicated? If I understand your present disposal 3 bolts the twist type should be no problem. When you order it is a bit confusing as to what comes with the disposal. When they show people often order some things when the get the disposal. You don't need any of those it all come with it the only thing you might need would be some different drain pipe but most likely you won't. I hope I was some help. Bill. Does the unit come with the rubber collar or do I need to buy that separately? If you mean the rubber collar that is visible when looking at the drain, with the rubber flaps, then yes it does.. is there a connection for the dish washer yes.. \",\n",

I replaced my old one with this without a hitch.. model number This may help InSinkErator Model BADGER-1: Badger 1 1/3 HP Garbage Disposal PRODUCT DETAILS - Bellacor Number:309641 / UPC:050375000419 Brand SKU:500181. can I replace Badger 1 1/3 with a Badger 5 1/2 - with same connections? Plumbing connections will vary with different models. Usually the larger higher amp draw wil not affect the wiring, the disposals are designed to a basic standard setup common to all brands. They want you to buy their brand or version or model. As long as the disposal is UL listed, United Laboratories, they will setup and bolt up the same.. Does this come with power cord and dishwasher hook up? It does not come with a power cord. It does come with the dishwasher hookup.. loud noise inside when turned on. sounds like blades are loose Check if you dropped something inside.Usually my wife put lemons inside make a lot of noise and I will have to get them out using my hands or mechanical fingers .. where is the reset button located on the bottom.

       " 'How many test kits are there in a box. How mant times can I test the water just once. there are several types of test in the box but they\\'re each designed to only be used once.. how many strips come in the kit, I need at least 12 The kit contains ONE strip per test. So if you want to test 12 water sources you could pool them. A better plan might be to buy two kits and test a pool of 6 water sources for each. That way if one set is positive, you only need to buy 6 more, for a total of 8 kits, rather than 12.. can more than one water source be tested? no, there is only one test kit for each substance. You could only test two if you mixed them together and did it as a pooled sample.. Has anyone used this to test for lead? Do you think it\\'s accurate? We used it to test for lead and we have no reason to believe the result was inaccurate. All of its other tests gave results that made me feel like the test was genuine.. I thought this had been endorsed by epa or state of OH as a home test option, but now I cannot find that on their websites. Does anyone endorse it? The state doesn\\'t have any protocols for rapid screening tests. does it have a colour indicator? All the tests are based on color . For the lead test, it\\'s a line indicator.. Does this kit tell you the amount of nitrates, or just tell you its too high? You would need to go through a lab to get the exact amount. With this kit you follow a color chart and compare to the EPA standard. Is there an expiration date on any of the tests? YES. On the back side of the plastic packaging which houses the contents including the instructions and different package envelopes which contain the chemicals for the variety of tests. There are no dates on the individual test envelopes that I can see. BUT there is definitely an expiration date on the back outside of the clear plastic packaging right next to the words \"Watersafe City Water Test Kit.\" I hope this is a clear explanation and that it helps.. does it test Coliform/ E. Coli ?? It has a test for bacteria for example E.Coli, however the bacteria test does not specify what kind you have in there.. does this test forlead Yes it does.. ',\n",

I have not purchased the humidifier that uses this filter yet, but on average how long does this filter last a rough estimate? The outer shell will fall apart in about a year of use, but the filter itself can survive much longer. Mine split at the seam, so it\\'s no longer round, but it still fits in the humidifier, and does its job. Cleaning the filter every week (especially if you have hard water) will degrade the material over time. I\\'ve used one in this manner for 3 years so far.. I need to replace a Holmes wick HWF-65T. Does this filter fit? The only humidifiers that this will fit are Sunbeam SCM866, SCM1895, and SCM1896 and Holmes HM1865 and HM1895 according to the filter box. So I think the answer to your question is \"No\". Sorry.. will this be replacement for holmes model hm 1745 filter? Dimensions 61/2 x 19 x 1 Its generic and does not work in a Holmes humidifier!!!. I would like to buy at least 5 filters. Could I pay 1 shipping price if you bundle it? Thank you. Hi: yes, we would bundle all 5 filters and charge one shipping price.. Is this model for the #1855 Holmes humidifier? its for the hwf65. I see other vendors do have the filter with the black mesh like the picture shows.. does this filter fit the Holmes HM1845? All I know is that I have an older model of the Holmes room humidifier. it doesn\\'t have any code on it. anyway, the filter was too tall, but it did fit. so I cut it in half (very hard to do with chic hands. but I did it) and now I have 2 filters for the price of one! other than all that, I\\'m happy w/it..

The filters I received did not have the black on the outside. What is the black for? I\\'m not an expert. Let me start to answer your question with a question. Is there an outer core in any other color that is made of a different material than the inner core? The inner core (white in the picture) is softer to the touch; the outer core, I suspect is what helps it stand up. I don\\'t think the color matters. The outer core feels like plastic. The inner core is definitely not plastic. I suspect the color does not matter. If this doesn\\'t completely answer your question, ask away. I enjoy doing this.. does it fit HM1700? I see someone left same question but I dont see answer. I just googled it and it says this filter works for it.. Does it work with Kenmore humidifier? Yes it does.. Do I need to tear off the black outside before I put the new filter into the machine? No. That is part of the filter and provides support.. Does this filter fit the Holmes hm5100? yes. Anyone have issues with the filter rotting? Or smelling really bad after a few weeks of use? Don\\'t have an issue with the filter rotting or smelling bad after usage. If you don\\'t plan on using it much, the water container should be emptied and the filter dried out.. Brand new only a month old and filter is brown and dired put? Your water may have a high mineral content. Please be sure to always have water in the unit to prevent the filter from drying. Also, we recommend changing the wick filter every 4 weeks.. Can this filter remove all mold spores I suppose so if you keep it clean I get a new filter each year. What are the dimensions of this filter?

As long as you are sure there is always water in the trap - it works fine. You will have some humidity, but no worse than anything else.. I\\'m looking to upgrade to a box that is smooth on the inside. Need to know if the inside of this one is smooth so it will clean throughly? Thank-you. No, it is not smooth.. How many loads can you wash before it needs emptied? I empty it out every single load. You can probably get two loads, unless it is something that produces a lot of lint.. How many loads can you wash before it needs emptied? I would check it after every dryer run. The water evaporates quickly.. Does it have screens in place where the vents are to prevent lint from blowing out of the vent holes? No. The way it works is that the tray is about half full of water (there is a line you fill it up to). The air hits the water and that catches MOST of the lint. It isn\\'t 100% effective - a little still flies out. But it is a good bit more effective than you\\'d think it would be. I think it basically gets the lint wet enough that it is too heavy to escape. Remember this is only catching the lint that the lint screen inside the dryer missed - it isn\\'t anything like the amount per load you pull out of the dryer lint screen.. can it be used for a gas drier I don\\'t really know as this didn\\'t work out for us. I guess I didn\\'t read the description well enough to know you needed to keep water in the boxt. It was going to be too difficult for us to constantly do that. However, I don\\'t see why not it wouldn\\'t work as the hose comes out of the dryer and into the little box. Surely if it can\\'t be used for a gas dryer, they would put that in the description. Sorry I could not be of more help.. Will the LTF Lint Dryer Kit work on a gas dryer? I believe there\\'s a disclaimer on these units that they should not be used on gas dryers. Gas dryers really need to be vented outdoors because, unlike electric dryers, there\\'s combustion and that results in fumes. The other vent shown with this one... Dundas Jafine TDIDVKZW ProFlex Indoor Dryer Vent Kit... states in the description \"Not be used with gas clothes dryers\". I would not do it.. ',\n",

If they are the short, stabbing variety it might be worth a try. If you have a regular shop vac I would recommend you try it first. It will definitely NOT be equivalent to an upright indoor vacuum on carpet. It just won\\'t be that easy. You need a level surface. If your lawn is really thick it \"could\" help.

       " 'Should this filter be replaced every year? If not, how do you clean it? Hi Marlene, First I should point out this product is not really a filter. It\\'s a wick that absorbs and holds moisture so the blower fan can push air through it and drive the water into the surrounding environment. How often it needs replacing depends upon how often the humidifier cycles and on the mineral content of your water. If you run your humidifier a lot and you are not using filtered water, then these wicks typically need replacing about every three months (at least). I use filtered water in my humidifier to reduce the mineral content but I still have to replace the wick every 5-6 months. It\\'s pretty simple to determine when your wick is clogged with minerals because the humidifier will basically run non-stop as there will be no moisture in the wick therefore no moisture going into the air. These wicks are not really cleanable because they are too fragile. Once they get clogged with minerals (i.e. \"lime\") they need to be disposed of and replaced.. does this fit ED11 600 device? Box says it fits 600, 400, and ED11.. I have a water softener, use the recommended setting of 43% hum. level, and wick lasted one mo. &amp; a day. Do replacement wicks last longer?

       " 'what is the CFM or power? The Broan 4130 is not rated for CFM because it is a non ducted hood. Probably about 100-150 cfm fan, 2850 rpm. You don\\'t want too much air blowing back in your face anyway. I hope this helps.. does it come with a power cord/ No. Unfortunately you would have to purchase the cord at a home depo or any hardware store for about $5.. I have no above cabinet......can I install on wall??? I wouldn\\'t. There are 4 holes on the back, but the metal of the hood isn\\'t very thick and wouldn\\'t support much weight. A cheap solution would be to get piece of shelving the size of the hood with two brackets mounted to the wall upside down and mount the hood to the bottom of the shelf. This will give you some extra storage space as well.. Does it get rid of kitchen smoke...that\\'s what I need. My kitchen doesn\\'t have an exhaust fan and every time I cook it smokes up the house. Yes it does. I don\\'t have an exhaust fan either, so this takes care of it. Diana D.. Can this be powered from an outlet plug or do I have to hard-wire it in? Use \"Broan HCK44 Power Cord Kit on individual display card\" by Broan-NuTone Amazon $8.97 3 ft cord to convert from hard wired.. It comes with a carbon filter? No. does it plug in to a regular 110 outlet? It could. It didn\\'t come with wire or a plug but it\\'s VERY simple. If you have ever replaced an outlet or the plug end of a cord you can install this.. Is the hood exactly 30\" wide? Our space above the range is just under 30\", and I\\'m afraid we\\'ll have to order the 24\" if the dimensions are exact. Yes, it is 30\" wide. Thanks.. How much clearence do I need to leave above the stovetop? Mine is like 18\" from the stove top.. Can you clean spattered egg yolk off of it? Mine is uncleanable and it\\'s white! No. ',\n",
       " 'Non-Ducted range Hood, does this mean there is no need to vent up thru the roof or out thru the wall? That\\'s correct. The air flows through the filter on the underside and out through the three columns of vent slats you see on the front of the range hood. There is no connection to other vents or ducts in a wall or through the roof.. I will be plugging the rangehood into the wall, will I need a power cord kit? I\\'m not sure what your setup is, but when I did mine, I hardwired the hood into the existing black and white wires that were used in the old hood. Chances are that if you don\\'t have the pre wired design that I had, you will need a power cord kit if you plan to physically plug the unit into a traditional wall socket.. Is this actual stainless steel or painted? Has anyone noticed any problems with rusting? Thanks. Its painted and no I haven\\'t noticed any problems with rust. It really looks nice in my kitchen and the price was awesome. I would recommend it.. Hi, the specification says it is 30 inch. My old range is actually 29.75 inch. Has anyone actually measured the exact length? 30 inch won\\'t fit. i agree with aaron 29 7/8. This is my first range hood. Do I need to purchase anything else with this purchase? Or do anything I need to install range hood come with it? As I recall, it came with all the necessary hardware. You\\'ll need tools like a drill and screwdriver, of course. I needed to add some wood furring strips to the underside of my cabinet to make it a flush mount, but I had the wood at home already, so I didn\\'t need to purchase any.. Does this come with the filter or do I have to buy filter separtely Yes, mine did. Is the charcoal filter a separate accessory from the aluminium mesh? The filter that came with the range hood was a one-piece unit, with the aluminum mesh on the exposed side and the filtering material inside. The filtering material against the aluminum mesh is black (carbon fiber?); the backside is blue. There are no grains of carbon, as there used to be in the 2-piece filter for my old range hood.. I want to mount it to the wall with no cabinet above it using L brackets. Would this be ok to do? If only L brackets are used in the back, I\\'d say no. There\\'s extra holes in the top and rear so at minimum, I\\'d secure the rear to wall studs with extra screws. The weight is more center/front and my concern is over time it would droop forward. It\\'s designed to mount under a cabinet. If there is something to mount the sides to it would work better.. what type of cover is over the light bulb ? It\\'s just a plastic diffuser. It locks into a couple of slots in the hood. You squeeze the two sides together to release tabs on the sides of the diffuser from the slots in the hood. Takes a standard base, 60watt or small CFL bulb.. can anyone please tell me what the depth of the unit is from the back to just where the grills and switches are. 12\".. ',\n",
       " 'How long have you had your hoses and have you experienced any leaks or leaking fittings? I\\'ve had my hoses for a few months, and I have not had any leaking, at all. The fittings have a very good rubber washer, which will hold up for years to come. These hoses have a 5 year warranty, but will last for a lot more than that. Braided hoses are the best for any kind of plumbing, as they are not prone to bursting, like none braided hoses are. Fluidmaster is the best brand..

       " 'my icemaker now makes chuncks of ice then stops but a lot of my freezer is coated with ice. is this from the icemaker or the water valve? The water valve is controlled by the ice maker. Mine stuck on over night and caused a flood. There is about a 7 second \"fill\" as the ice maker cycles. You may want to check to see if it cycles, does it get all the ice out before filling again. If it iver fills it will spill into the feezer and make icecycles.. Will this work with a Kenmore Refrigerator #106.50522100 ? WE have a whirlpool and it works so it should they are the same company.

Mine has worked for nearly 2 years, flawlessly.. What would cause the water line to turn on off on off while filling? I too have been having trouble with the ice maker over filling. The new ice maker should not do that, I installed one and it worked perfectly and cranked tons of ice. You do need to make sure it is plugged in properly and there is no damage to the power cable or connectors. I think I left my old cable and reconnected it to the unit and it worked fine.. does it have a cycle time adjustment The cycles are controlled by a synchronous motor (60 Hz) and cycle control gear.

Does this freezer automatically defrost? I don't know---we just had huge amounts of ice form in back and called the service dept that wants to charge us a lot of $$ to come and look at it. $89 just to come out and then minimum of $100 to start repair. Our unit is only 1.3 years old.. is it reliable or does it break down It no longer 'breaks down' because we found the fault. This model anyway, was NOT tested for areas with slightly above average humidity. The air circulation vents in freezer section clog up with ice, even though the fan is running, and the de-ice element, deep inside the freezer is working! Every 2 weeks and I have to do a manual defrost of the freezer, otherwise, if I get a large buildup of ice in that area, the sensor will again fail. I won't buy any more LG product based on this. (We also have a large flat screen LG TV, now out of guarantee, with failures in responding to remote, and the screen displaying vertical lines). We have read that LG make inferior product, that their concept is that it's cheaper to do this due to their massive sales, so they can absornb the repairs. Heck, when out of guarantee it'll cost you an arm and a leg anyway. The old Hitachi we chucked out, too small, never missed a beeat in 2 decades.. Powering: 110 or 220 V / 50 or 60 Hz? 110 not sure if 50 or 60. how much energy does it use I have absolutely no idea how I would be able to know this. I can't imagine it is very much, being new and smaller.. Is this appliance quiet enough to keep in the house as a spare? Yes. It's small and sounds like a regular refrigerator, not super quiet like a SubZero but not at all loud. I use mine as an only refrigerator (one person household). My dog did was afraid of the old one, she went through about 4 screens last summer.... She's OK with this one.. Hard to tell from picture..does it have 2 doors? Almost looks like is only one door that covers both compartments? It has two doors, top is the refrigerator and the bottom is the freezer. I use this as a spare refrigerator and have it in my garage. I love it!. The description says ice maker included. Is this correct? Oh gosh - I do not think so! I will have my manager check today and let you know!. Do you know what is the clearance between this unit and the cabinets (top and sides)? Thanks. Dunno. Is it a fridge? If so buy it at your risk.. . My LG big expensive double door.. has a major design flaw. The cold air recirculation vents in the deep freeze are too small, so that it rapidly, in a couple of weeks, ices up. The auto-defroster cannot handle it. The circulation fan starts clunking as it hits the ice buildup behind the deepfreezer. . I have to do a manual defrost. I have cut the holess much bigger and it's better, but still needs a manual defrost. This last time I made the holes enormous, so lets see if that helps. If I just left it alone, and not manual defrosted, the deice sensor burns out and and that costs $$$. It has already burnt out 2, thats why I have to fiddle with it. Maybe LG just churn out new product and hope for the best, with little or no testing.

Will the lid fit and stay on this if you leave out the filter and top water reservoir so this can be used as a tea dispenser? Yes it will stay on.

We have well water with a strong sulfur smell and taste It\\'s the best I have found for well water. I found the faucet attachments do not do the trick and the smaller pitchers\\' carbon is not strong enough.. How do you know when to change the filter? A calendar sticker comes with the dispenser, along with a marker that estimates the date to change (about 3 months after installation). But I guess it also depends on how unclean the water is. I wouldn\\'t recommend using for longer than they recommend because seeing the buildup of sediments in the filter is scary!. What is weight of the filled pitcher? is it difficult to lift? Arthritis in thumbs and difficulty holding onto heavy items. Cannot see the handle. Not sure of the weight...maybe 4-6 lbs. But at the front and back of the pitcher, the \"cover\" extends about 3 inches, so there\\'s more than enough room to comfortably hold on and move it..

No. You have to add water yourself, either with shower hose or bucket. It's not that hard, though.. u dont got to hook it up to the sink do u for the water to go in and does it drain all the water out of clothes like a reg washer does you cant hook it up to the sink/ has to be filled manually by hand. IT DOESNT HAVE A SPIN CYCLE SO NO IT DOESNT DRAIN THE WATER OUT OF THE CLOTHES AT ALL.. Does this machine have a limit of how hot the water can be? (The Basecamp washer instructions say the water used should not exceed 113 F.) Thanks it is manual fill... as in you fill it with water, so its as hot or cold as you chose. I use mine in the shower and fill it with a shower hose. It is also manual drain, which is why I use it in the shower, the hose on the back needs to be up when in use and down to drain, it is a very low draining hose, so you need either a floor drain or use in shower as i do. It is very light weight, so I simply put it in the shower when I need to wash laundry and store it in the closet when not in use.. Has the timer went out? and how do you fix the timer I mostly use it for making bubble hash, but i have used it to wash an outfit or two a few times. As long as you follow the directions and dont overload the washer it should run great. I have 300+ hours on it myself and i'v loned it out several times. Still works awesome.. how many cloths can it contain? Less than a traditional washer, more than some of the smallest compact models. While everybody's idea of a load is somewhat different, and working with the pounds specified by manufacturers is not always intuitively easy, I'd say that it would be about a half load or a bit less than a normal moderately sized load for a traditional model. Before you purchase this model, however, you should read my other comments here, along with some of the other notes. This washer is a rugged little machine, which is made in America to serve principally in janitorial operations as a mop head and rag washer for a janitor's closet. As such, it can be a very cheap and rugged alternative for home use, but IT IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC WASHER, in the modern sense. It is much more akin to antique washers, as it is really just a pail with a timer controlled agitator and a drain hose. That's it. You have to fill it with water, drain it, fill it again to rinse, drain it, maybe rinse again, and all by hand, and then wring out your clothes and dry them.. how many gallons of water will this hold? It takes 10 gallons to reach the minimum fill line before I added any laundry items. However, when I added 4 pairs of fleece pants the water registered at the maximum fill line. For me then, with my water tank on my boat, I have to remember that a single load of laundry using 3 fills to the minimum will use 30 gallons of precious water tank water. First fill is with laundry detergent; second fill I add 1 cup vinegar to assist the rinse out of detergent; and the final fill is to rinse out all vinegar/ soap residue. This vinegar technique does cut down on the lint retention on clothing. There is nothing else to capture lint. I would like to know what others do about laundry lint. I do wash dark clothes separately. The washer will take more than 4 pairs of fleece, I just filled the washer with water before adding clothes to see what amount of gallons I could use to the minimum fill line. I like my washer. It sure beats loading a harbor cart and walking half a mile to the nearest laundromat. I also use a spin-dry extractor which allows clothes on plastic hangers to hang dry overnight.. How fast is the agitation? I want it to be very delicate for my valuable clothes and I'm worried it will be to rough... The agitation is pretty powerful. It's sort of a whirlpool action. You can always set the timer for a short amount of time and monitor your clothes (or put them in a garment bag).. \",\n",
       " 'how do you calibrate it It\\'s called \"The Salt Test\". You take about a table spoon of salt in a little cup or something of that nature, and add a few drops of water to it. Place the salt and hygrometer in a liplock bag for 6-12 hours and it should read 75 %, if not, turn the little screw type thing in the back.........but be careful, my last one broke on first adjustment.. Would this model be ideal for a gun safe? No, I tried to dial it in and it broke on the first twist. I didn\\'t try to get my money back since it was so cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for. Check out the ones they sell at cigar shops then come back to Amazon and spend a few more bucks for something more dependable.. Is the hygrometer metal and glass, or plastic? metal and glass. What is the diameter? 2.25 or 1.8 or 1-3/4 2\" across dial including bezel. 1\"3/4 across back. 5/8\" deep.. why is there a rubber ring around the hygrometer? Seems like you would need to take it off, or remove the magnet. Otherwise, how will the air circulate into the unit where the sensor is?. I\\'d like to use this hygrometer to keep track of the humidity in my acoustic guitar\\'s case. Do you think it would work well for this purpose? Yes, it works great! In fact, I replaced my fancy (expensive) digital hygrometer with this little dial hygrometer. I highly recommend it for the guitar case.

Anyways: what kind of technology is used for the sensor? How many years is it stable for??? Maybe that\\'s a question for the manufacturers. Western humidor has a call line for questions at 1-877-627-4798. I own 4 of the caliber III. For over a year now, it\\'s been running steady and accurate. Reacts almost immediate to humidity changes.. I bought this item from you and it is not even close to accurate, How do I calibrate it? Or should I just return it. I have a caliber IV hygrometer for a humidor which performs very well. To calibrate mine I followed the instructions and removed the activator tab.. can show temperature in Celsius degrees? Yes, iddy bitty switch on the top right or the unit for F (Liberia, Myanmar, and the USA) and then the rest of the world in C.. What is the humidity range? 20% to 99%. 1. What are those two unlabeled buttons of the front for? 2. How easy is it to change battery? 2. It\\'s easy to take the battery out and replace it, but there is no stop, so the battery can fall out when the entire battery holder comes out (if you\\'re not careful). This happened to me and the battery fell on the floor. Now I don\\'t see in what orientation the battery should be when a new one is put in (positive up or down).. ',\n",

The package I received does state 1 micron sediment water filter cartridge on the label. I have been using them for several months now with no complaints.. which filter are they used in.? Any 10\" water filter.. What is the difference between these and the coiled looking ones? And do these fit as well as or better than the Whirlpool WHKF-GD05? Thank you! The Purenex 1M-4PK is a type of hard foam wound to form the shape of the replacement coiled ones. it works well and can be cut to the exact size as it is exactly 10 inches long. I do not know if it equal to or better than the WHKF-GD05.. I need 2 1/2 sediment 1micron for reverse osmosis This filter is a 9-7/8-inch by 2-1/2-inch 1 micron sediment cartridge.

       " 'if the filter mwf is bad the refrigirator dont give me water on the door usually. But you could also have a frozen water line in the door just behind the dispenser. Google your refrig on the web for \"no water in dispenser\" for answers on fixing that. I had a frozen water line and so changing my filter didn\\'t do anything. Before you buy a new filter, try the \"by pass\" that came with your refrig when you first bought it. If the by pass allows the water to flow then, your filter is plugged up.. Water Pressure: Does anyone know if this filter is related to low flow? i had the same problem with mine. about 6-7 months later the water delivery started to drop. i changed the filter but it did not increase. my next conclusion was a blockage of some sort. i happen to have a oil changer for my cars that works on suction. i pulled the fridge out shut off water supply removed the filter and put in the plug that came with the fridge. then i hooked up the inlet to the fridge to the oil changer. pumped it up and the pressed the water dispenser bar in front of the fridge. it sucked out some dirt and some kind of thick little globs of who knows what. put it all back together and the water flowed like it was day one. here it is 8 months later and i see i need to blow it out again. also fyi, you do not have to use the ge filters. a company called swift green filters makes one that fits. model sgf-g9 i found it for about 18.00 it is rated the same as the ge but for less money. as for the oil changer it is a mightyvac mv7400. it was about 50.00 but worth it because we have 3 cars and at 30.00 a pop for an oil change it was worth buying and it doubles for the suction for the fridge. hope this helps you.. I currently have a GWF flter in my fridge. I just ordered this and it says MWF on it. Does it fit my GWF fridge? The MWF is a new slimmer design It replaces GE water filter part numbers GWF, GWFA, GWF01, GWF06, MWFA, and Hotpoint HWF, HWFA . An adapter may be needed if you have the following filters: FXRC, FXRT, MXRC, HXRT, WR97X10006, and Kenmore 46-9905.. How often should these be changed? We had a Sub Zero and just moved to a house that has GE Monogram appliances and I am not familiar with this system. Most places in US, yearly. Florida, twice a year. Based on average use. A household with 4 kids differs from a household of 2 mature adults. My monogram is 14 years old. perfect so far.. Does low ice production mean that it is time to change the filter? I haven\\'t had that issue but I think I still can help. Your fridge should have an indicator when the filter needs to be changed, BUT if it doesn\\'t, then on average, every 3 to 4 months is what I use for a guide. However, I HAVE discovered that there are times when the water speed is very slow, & not strong, however even though the indicator isn\\'t showing the need for a change, if I change the filter the flow is perfect again. So, I reckon you should try changing it if it\\'s been about 3 - 4 mos. If that doesn\\'t help the ice poduction for you, I\\'d check with the manufacturer. Guess they just don\\'t make \\'em like they used to. Hope that helped you.. How many gallons does it filter? According to the manufacturer it will filter approximately 300 gallons of water or 6 months. In my experience the water flow starts to slow down when the filter needs replacing. Another way to ensure that you replace it at the right time is to write the date of instillation on the filter with a black marker.. do you have to prime the filter before installing it ? The filter does NOT have to be primed. However, after it is installed, you must run at least a gallon of water through it. Be careful while running that gallon as the high water pressure may cause it to splash for a few seconds.. Does this filter remove Fluoride from the water? According to Manufacturer, this does not remove fluoride from water.. I have an older GE refrigerator. The model # is TFX26ZPDA BB The serial # is SZ22137. Would this filter work for our refrigerator? Hello, if the model number will be the same only then its going to fit. do you need to turn off the water before replacing the filter? No. You do not. It will dribble a tad but that\\'s it. Run a gallon of water through it after changing it and you\\'re done.. ',\n",

I use it for cello and it works fine except for sometimes in the lower register like open C. How long does the battery last if left on the thermo-hygrometer setting constantly? Well, when I first bought mine, I forgot to turn it off about 2days and it drained my batt. The metronome acted funny when there is not enough juice power. I guess that because the battery included with purchased maybe to its dued date. With new battery, I have been more careful to turn it off when not use it. Still last for several months. The product is great. Recommended to friends & teachers. They all love it. :). What is the country of origin? My tuner says \"Made in Korea.\". Does the tempo of the metronome reset itself after being turned off? Or would it stay at the same tempo that I was using (before turning it off)? It stays on the last tempo that was set before turning off. It doesn\\'t reset.. when i add this to my cart, it shows a picture of Intelli DM8lt - is this truly a recent model Intelli IMT-301? Yes.

They protect wires running through a material (ie glass, metal, plastic etc etc) from chafing which could cause a short or malfunction.. Will these fit 1/2 inch hole? I drilled a 1/2 hole and ordered 1/2 inch grommets awhile ago but they are 2 big! lol Nope. These guys were definitely not the right fit.

You might be able to us them on something slightly thicker but not much. They are very pliable. Hope this helps.. Will this create an air-tight water-tight seal around a 1/4\" tubing? No. It\\'s a close fit, but will not seal. Depending upon your application, you might be able to apply a sealant that would satisfy, but these are made to reduce chafing of wiring or tubing that passes through a panel, not creating a seal..

We need a dryer vent cover that is a flat attachment to the wall. Is there any protrusion behind the plate that attaches it to the wall? Nothing behind the plate. There are four pre-cut screw holes at the four corners of the plate to attach the plate to the siding of your house. The original owner of our house drilled four holes into the siding/insulation and then insert wall anchors into the holes before inserting the four screws to hold the plate in place. It worked well.. how does this thing work? does the lid open like a kettle when the dryer is on? There\\'s a shuttle valve inside the big section and it moves inside the top comes off to clean the vent it works well u might have to trim some flash off the rails if it doesn\\'t slide easy. will this one work if the vent is coming out the ground No. Has anyone used this product to prevent cold air from leaking in from a through the wall bathroom exhaust fan. We live in Southern California. I\\'m not sure if a bath exhaust fan would have enough pressure to open the vent. The vent uses a inverted plastic \\'cup\\' riding in the center of the assembly to seal the vent when not in use. The \\'cup\\' may weigh a little to much to open with a fan, but works great with a dryer. You might try contacting the manufacturer.. has anyone installed it specifically to prevent mice from coming into dryer vent? if so did it work for that? thank you, Don\\'t know about \"specifically\" but I don\\'t see how mice could get into the vent when the dryer is off. When the dryer is running there is a \"gap\" but there\\'s also the \"wind\" coming thru the vent so I wouldn\\'t think mice would climb into the hot wind.. Does this come with attached piping to fit into existing piping? No it doesn\\'t. We did not have any pipe as this was new construction, it ran $4 at the hardware store. I have had these before and the old pipe worked on this.. can it be used with bathroom exhaust fan Yes we have used ours for about 6 months and it works fine. Our vent was open to the outside before and we had wind noise, with this, no more wind noise. Our fans are fairly strong air flow but I think any exhaust fan would open it for venting.. What color is this product? White.. What is the best way to clean out this dryer vent ? The cover opens and then the baffle inside can be lifted off so you can clean everything quickly and easily..

       " \"Can I take the cap off and use manually in disposal? or is the cap tamper resistant? Another reviewer mentioned this &amp; I just want to make sure I can. This is set up to provide a metered amount during disposal use, you do not want to do this manually because you'll end wasting a lot. The are a lot of other products out there to add to a septic system manually that work great. Don't waste your time and money trying to do it with this item.. How long will this cartridge charge an ISE compact 3/4 disposal? (Ball park) close to 8-9 months. How do I know that the bottle is empty and I have to replace it? When the dark fluid is gone and the container is clear and empty- you need to have access to be able to it because you only know visually. Every time I turn on my disposal the cartridge falls out. It is the first replacement and did not do this with the original. Anyone experiencing this? hi I personally have never experienced it falling out I don't know if you don't click that in tight sometimes you have to push it up hard and try to pull it out yourselfif it continues falling out then I would send it back maybe it's a defect I hope this is helpful to you try pushing it up hard. Does anyone know if this product can be used if you have an aerobic septic system or will it harm the microbes? I was sold on the feature that this Insinkerator product will enhance the microbial activity in my septic. I had never used a garbage disposal before my kitchen remodel in mid 2014. I have not seen any diverse activity in my septic sas of now with the use of this product.. Has anyone had an issue with leaking from the cartridge after it's been changed? I have used this product for over 10 years. Once, and only once I did feel a drip while I installed the new cartridge. All I did was to press the button and push the bottle in again. Never a leak since. From my experience, if it leaks, it is the installer's fault ;-) Don't worry, just push the release button and push the bottle all the way in.. \",\n",
       " \"My garbage disposal doesnt have a hole underneath to stick the jambuster into. so what now? Well, make sure that there isn't a cap over a center hole on the bottom! Also, most will have a red button on the bottom that is a circuit breaker. Press that in a test run it. Assuming that doesn't work, kill the circuit to the disposer. Then use the oldest method in the books. Stick a broom handle down in side and lever it around and around, reversing direction. Use a flashlight to look inside for things like glass or flatware and carefully fish them out. Rinse only if the water is flowing through. Try and fire it up! If you hear nothing but a click, which can happen at the same moment as the switch clicks so it is easy to miss, the breaker may pop again. Try it all a few times before ordering a new one! Good luck!. I have tried turning it back and forth but it won't budge...should I keep forcing it? Yes. Will this work on a 555SS Insinkerator disposal that is jammed? Insinkerator sells only one size JamBuster for all their models. It only took a couple of wiggles for me and was cheaper than a plumber visit of a replacement. I had a sawed-off piece of broom handle, just in case, to pry from the top. Be sure to turn off the power to the disposal.. I can turn the insinkerator using this, but still stiff, even after turning it a dozen times. I still get hum -no spin- only when turn on. Next steps? Work the wrench back and forth in both directions. If the wrench will not turn easily, it is OK to use some force. Continue working with the wrench until it turns freely in complete circles in both directions. Check the overload protector. The overload protector is located under the sink, on the bottom of the disposer, facing the floor. It is a small red button. If the overload protector has tripped, you will see the red button dropped down. Press the red button. With the disposer powered OFF, check inside the grinding chamber. Look down into the disposer using a flashlight. Do not place your hand into the disposer. If you see anything in the disposer, remove it using tongs or pliers.Turn on the water, then the disposer. The disposer should now run. If the problem is rust or mineral deposits stuck on the blades, you can try a chemical like CLR Calcium Lime Rust Remover. Use it to liquify the mineral deposits and free the blades so they will spin. If the disposer continues to jam, you may need to service or replace it.. what is the size (diameter) of the face of this wrench? I don't know the size but it fit my Insinkerator perfect. I get the feeling it is pretty much a standard size for all garbage disposals. Worked great and fixed it within minutes.. We have a Badger 500-1 garbage disposal, will this fit? The Insinkerator web site lists this exact same wrench as a Badger accessory. So, Insinkerator says it fits. Good luck with fixing your jam and be sure to have the power disconnected. I went to the circuit breaker box to do so.. \",\n",

I know this sound baffle pops into the sink, but how do I remove the old splash guard? Does a splash guard and sound baffle serve the same purpose? Erin: Just reach in and pull out the old splash guard/baffle and press in the new one. Wetting the new unit will make pressing it in that much easier.. Can I use this in a Waste King Disposal? The one that I have does not allow water to drain. I am not familiar with the Waste King brand. The measurements of this item are 3 5/16\" diameter by 3/4\" depth.. Will this work in an evolution disposal? Yes. How does this muffle noise and prevent splash back with the large holes--you can see the bottom of the disposer thru the large center opening? Michele, it really does, probably because of the way it makes fluid flow. Easy out for cleaning. Only complaint would be that waste needs help down thru as it gets caught on the flaps.

No transition pipe was needed, I used 5-1/2 inch metal worm drive clamps to fix the Lambro duct to the galvanized pipe and to the starter collar.

Thanks No. what is the approx compressed length? thx! I believe it is about 16 or 17 inches! Also the brand label is stapled on to one of the ends so you have to remove it before you use it!

I\\'m using it for a portable a/c vent into ceiling space. It is kinda thin and doesn\\'t seem durable enough for a furnace vent. How long does this ducting stretch out to? I would think it would stretch to the 5 feet advertised. When it arrived, it was probably less than 2.5 feet. I only needed about a foot and I only stretched the piece out a few inches. It is similar to the 4 inch aluminum dryer duct you can buy most anywhere. You need to be careful not to crush it but it worked fine for me.

Are those the three different filters? The filter requirements is a bit confusing. Three HEPA filters and three carbon filters are required for the larger room model # HAP756-U which I recently purchased and currently using. (Two of both the HEPA and carbon filters are required for the smaller room unit HAP726) Three true HEPA filters were included with the my unit and already installed (there are no discernible marking on the installed filters I can detect indicating a filter model number). However, there were no carbon filters installed or included with my purchased unit but I did purchase a pack of 4 which I installed when I set up my unit. I purchased a package of 2 Holmes make HEPA replacement filters (HAPF600D - B Filters) at the same time.

       " 'What about using it with the Best Air \"Water &amp; Scaling\" treatment to address both the scaling and bacteria issues? I\\'ve used it for both in a wicking humidifier (as opposed to one using heat or sonic vibrations to atomize the water). We use the humidifier nearly continuously since both our heater and central air dry the house terribly. Note that the treatment prevents scaling by keeping the deposits soft so that you can wipe/wash them away. It cannot keep the calcium from precipitating out of the water. Bacteria will build up over several months time if you don\\'t change your filter, no matter what solution you use. The anti-bacterial formulas in all products like this one kill of most of the bacteria/alge, but cannot be 100% effective. I change my wicking filter ever couple of months. The Best Air Treatment keeps my humidifier fresh and clean between filter changes.. Does it have added artificial fragrance? NO it does not. That is one of the things I like about it. ( NO SMELLS ) Richard. Is it supposed to be mixed with the water that is actually used for humidifying, or is it just a cleaning agent, to be rinsed out before reg use? As I understand the directions, you are to add one cap full each time your refill the water reservoir. It helps eliminates odors and helps keep the humidifier free of fungus and mildew.. Will this work with a cool mist humidifier? Helps control bacterial & algae build-up. We bought this because of the company claim. We have not owned our unit long enough. To say it works. Check to see if your unit allows for this type of this type of item. If it does. I would give it a try. Crane Drop Shape Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier with 2.3 Gallon output per day. Crane Hs-3161 Drop Shape Humidifier Filter. We bought this unit this liquid this filter. So far are Happy.. Why can\\'t this be used in ultrasonic humidifiers? Hi. It\\'s just too dangerous that\\'s why. Ultrasonic and vaporizer type humidifiers expel the water + chemical solution throughout the room. Standard evaporation type humidifiers just evaporates water, and the chemical stays in the tank to do its job. These chemicals are alkyl dimethyl and diethyl ammonium chlorides. It is highly concentrated in the bottle, and causes damage to mucosal surfaces as well as the cornea. It\\'s just like any chemical (chloride for example) that is dangerous at high concentrations.. Why can\\'t I use it in a vaporizer It\\'s to keep bacteria, algae etc. down, it works in cold water and vaporizers heat the water. This heated could be poisionous to breathe, use it only as recommended which is in a humidifier.. Can this be used for ultrasonic humidifiers? Not for use in vaporizers or ultrasonic humidifiers. what are the active ingredients in this product? dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlorides 1.125% and dimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chlorides 1.125% and inert ingredients 97.750%. Can this be used in Honeywell humidifiers? It isn\\'t a manufacturer-specific product, so while I can\\'t say for sure, I do not see why it would be a problem. Most humidifiers are built fairly similarly.. Is it safe for plants? That\\'s a question I can\\'t answer with certainty. I\\'ve experienced yellowish edges on the leaves and some spots here and there. Not sure if it was from this product or something else. Overall my plants were ok.. ',\n",
       " 'I understant the way it collects the lint, but what happens to the humidity? Will I end up with wet walls? There\\'s no way to trap the humidity. When necessary I open doors and windows to ventilate, but often in the winter when it\\'s cold and dry the warm humid air is welcome in my apartment. In the summer I don\\'t really use the dryer much anyway. I have not had a problem with moisture but my apartment is larger and the dryer is in a relatively open area. If it is in a small, poorly ventilated space this may be an issue.. Does this kit work with Haier electric dryers? Yes, i have the haier compact electric dryer that i use it with.. is it possible to run vent for air leaving this thing into bath fan vent line? Michael, I think you would have a problem with lint and moisture not being drawn upward and what would the bath vent do with the lint if it got there? I bought this for my fifth wheel, but it just filled the bed room with moisture.. How heavy is the base? If I have this sitting above the dryer on the back of the washer, will it topple over? The base is made of light weight plastic. I have a hard time keeping the top attached to the base and believe this is more likely to pull off than it would be to topple over once the base is filled with the correct amount of water.. How often does it need to be cleaned out? It varies. I guess it\\'s according to how often you use the dryer and the type of clothing you are drying.. can this be used on a gas dryer ??? No. can i adapt this to vent thru a widow? Yes that\\'s what I did.. I have a full size dryer. this product won\\'t work on the dryer? It\\'s works fine with a full size LG dryer. I am interested in buying the \"Avanti 110-Volt Automatic Dryer\". Do I need this vent as well? I figure I purchased both if needed and save some time. got one. Does this vent contain heat?? Can you use it on portable air conditioners This vent does not contain heat. The heat from the dryer goes into the container and hits the water that you put in the container. The water attracts the lint and then the warm air escapes through the five large openings. I do not see how this can be used for a portable air conditioner.. ',\n",
       " 'can be used for a dryer vent hose Absolutely not. Dryer vent house takes high temps. That\\'ll cause a fire.. I need two 4\\'-0\" long pieces. Can this duct be cut in half? Yes, but not real clean. The spiral wrap of the wire requires a bit of an angle on the cut and you\\'ll need a wire cutter for the reinforcing wire. It\\'ll be a little ragged but it can be done.. Is this heavy duty enough to use for a flush line on an ag pump, 20 psi for approx 1 minute? Is it clear enough to see dirty water? Thanks. Sorry... im not sure. It\\'s strong enough for a ferret to run through, though :-) and yes you could see dirty water. It might b.e hazy a little to see through but is pretty clear.. does this retract on its own after you stretch it out or does it stay in the same position? It retracts a little bit, but after you stretch it out it mostly stays that far stretched.. Is it 8 ft long before being stretched out, or after? It\\'s about 8 ft AFTER being stretched.. is this really clear and easy to see though. Looking to get it for kids project? Yes it is very easy to see what ever object is put in it. We used it for our ferret, she could be seen quite clearly. It\\'s 8 foot length was great. We attached them to several cages to make a maze. That way she wasn\\'t roaming loose in the house and we could find her easily.. ',\n",
       " 'can it be installed with a copper sink? I had it installed in a granite composite sink and it used standard fittings. I called the manufacturer and got info from them. Does it accommodate a dishwasher? Yes it does, just remember to remove the plug where the dishwasher drain hose connects.. What does \"lifetime\" mean. If I am 25 and it konks out when I am 50, what do I get? Is it pro-rated? In 25 years the company may no longer be in business. The warranty reads as long as you have the disposal and you have not done something to break it, like trying to grind things that the instruction manual tells you it can\\'t grind, it will be fixed or replaced. There is nothing, that I remember, in the warranty about proration. I believe the warranty also said it provides both parts and labor to fix it. I would go to the website and read the warranty on the unit. The plumber that installed it said it is one of the best disposals he has installed. This is a very powerful disposal, you will see that the first time you turn it on.. does the splash guard come inside the box with the legend 8000 disposal Yes. Product specs say 14.2\" high. Does that include flange? My drain line is 14.5\" below sink base and runs directly below disposal. Will it fit? From the underside of the sink to the bottom of the disposal it\\'s about 15.5\". The drain centers about 7.5\" from the underside of the sink. Hope this helps!. A plumber told me that 1.0 horsepower units are not recommended for undermount sinks. Is this true? I\\'ve already purchased the unit... I had a second thought about the waste king - It was my fault but I thought you and everyone should be aware. The tightening nut at the top of the unit needs to be watched for loosening by itself, when it does, it leaks in the cabinet. Just keep it tight and it works great.. Has any one had problems with the \"easy mount\" on a SS sink? The cushion mount slipped out of the mount ring on the second day.Is vibration a problem? See the youtube video called \"Waste King Garbage Disposal EZ mount system\" and/or the video \"How to Easily Purchase & Install a \"Waste King\" Garbage Disposal from Amazon.com\". You need to fit the rubber ring properly. Put the hard, screw-on, silver ring on first. Then the black rubber ring. Lift the silver ring up and out of the way so you can fit the rubber ring INTO THE GROOVE ON THE DISPOSAL and then let the silver ring drop back down on top of the rubber ring.. I am frustrated that the opening (the collar) in my sink is so small with this model that I can\\'t get my hand in there to get things out! Help! Probably a result from a law suit brought on by somebody that could stick their hand down the opening.. Just install one by my contractor, but I was very shockd because of the drameticlly loud sound when I turn on. Seems not right, can anyone help me? We purchased our Waste King L-8000 on Amazon. The noise is low....like a humming. Of course, you can tell it is on. I suggest contacting your contractor. It should not be \"dramatically loud.\" If it continues; contact Waste King, they have great service and I believe no cost to you.. My existing disposal is hard-wired (not plugged into the wall) Can I hard wire Waste King or do I need to install outlet? Yes, the bottom of the unit is removable allowing you to remove the power cord. Per the manufacturers website you can hardwire the unit without voiding the warrantee.. ',\n",
       " 'What\\'s the pipe size that can be used for this? Can this be used for the same pipe size? at each end of the filter it comes with fittings that are 1/4 male. you can use 1/4 ice maker brained stainless supply line hose or you can make your own hoses by using 1/4 poly tube and put the nuts at the end and use that. you could also use copper lines too. you will need two hoses one for each side, both 1/4. I had the gold Argenion 20,000 gallon filter for my fridge that has 1/4 in male ends. Will this work with my 1/4 in female threaded ends I have?? This filter has (female) 1/4\" threaded openings on both ends that accept 1/4 \" male fittings. Hope this helps?. I am replacing a Omni filter r400. It is connected to the small copper tubing. Can I use existing copper tubing and set up? yes,good luck on your project. check your thread, should be good to go. update you may want to use plumbers tape on your threads, and do not over tighten; you will do a good job, just take your time, and check for leaks until they are okay!. Does the filter actually need to be mounted to a wall, or will it function normally laying on the ground behind the fridge? You can have it laying on the floor. I mounted mine on string from the refrigerator so it would move back and forth with the refrigerator and be up above the trim around the base of the wall. Now I can push my refrigerator back another 1/2 inch or so.. What is the country of origin? It says made in USA.. Has anyone had problems with leaks? I was reading reviews on other filters where the fittings failed causing 10s of thousands of $ damage, scary... Installed it about 2 months ago. Haven\\'t had any problems.. I have Argenion in line which is out of business . Can I replace with Watts which looks similiar? Yes, that is what I had previously. I believe the Watts is just slightly longer than the other one, but no more than an inch or so.. Can I connect this filter in line using 1/4\" copper tubing? Can it be mounted horizontal? Does it have a replaceable filter? I can answer a couple. 1. Not sure about copper tubing. 2. Yes you can mount horizontal. I\\'ve got mine under my fridge. 3. No, this filter is it. It\\'s an inline filter, you replace the whole thing. I love this filter. I replaced my fridge one with this. Water tastes much better and much less \"floaties\" from ice cubes.. What happens when the filter arrives at the end of its life (e.g. five years) - will water stop coming through? No. Does this filter include mounting hardware as pictured no mounting hardware filter great has the brass end for 1/4\" hose. ',\n",
       " \"I purchased this speed controller for an tjedlund M-8 fan but it doesn't slow down enough. Does this speed controller have a low end adjustment? There's a small screwdriver speed adjustment (on the side, I think). You use this to set the speed so that the motor won't stall. Set the knob at minimum speed, then adjust the screwdriver setting so that the motor is just turning. Try powering it off and back on to make sure you are giving it enough juice to start.. Can I use this to control a Dayton (model 1HLA3) 16 inch exhaust fan? Don't know, I used one on a NON compactor ceiling fan, It works Great!!!. Any you folks tell me if this might be an effective &amp; reliable dimmer for 12v LED lighting strips? Those marketed for that purpose appear to be junk. The quality of this unit is not great.. I make Knifes and need to reduce the sfm of a bandsaw from 2360sfm to 1600sfm?? I doubt it, I suspect your motor may be a capacitor start and a higher than 2.5 amp load, which are specifically not supported.. Will this work with any fireplace blower when also connected to a thermal switch? If it works with your blower, it will work with a thermal switch. I use this switch on my two Lennox gas fireplaces and wired a http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RYU4W/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 thermostat inline underneath. The switch is on the wall and the thermostat is attached to the sheet metal underneath the firebox.. Can I control three ceiling fans with one control? You could probably daisy chain them if the total current draw doesn't exceed the rated capacity of the unit.. When this is used with a blower motor that uses 100 watts of power at 115 volts, do you use fewer watts when you run the blower more slowly? Yes, i used a watt meter and the draw at full speed was 58 watts, turned down to lowest was 38 watts. I use it on an air filter unit and it traps more dust on the lower speed. The higher speed without the speed controller just blew dust around, and trapped less dust.. Can it be used with a single phase 1 amp blower motor? Yes. \",\n",
       " 'Will this switch allow me to control the low speed on a 3 speed conventional Hunter Douglas ceiling fan ? Yes, but put the fan on high speed and control the speed with the new variable speed switch.. I\\'m looking for a variable speed control for a 3.5 amp 1/3 hp induction motor, will this one work? As long as this is not a capacitor start motor it will work. I have a 115v ; 5.9A attic fan. Should I go with this 8.0max amps switch OR the 6.0max amps? Will the 6.0 run warmer than this 8.0? My son in law is a building electrician.I asked him the same question when I bought the 8 amp.He said to get as far away as you can from the 5.9 amp motor.The 8 amp is a very good price and you won\\'t find it on ebay because I looked. If you can afford the 10 amp get that one.You do not want to deal with the switch getting warm.That 8 amp switch I bought is working beautifully.You will burn up the 6 amp switch!!!. I have a 1/3 hp 5.3 amp Sears 258.640770 whole house fan, which has a capacitor, which I assume is a start assist. Will this switch work? It works great in my Sears whole house attic fan circa 1986. Don\\'t know if it has a capacitor or not.. Can this run a pair of ceiling fans with full vari control and no humm? Can you get it made to fit a slot in a rec wall plate? I don\\'t know if it will hadndle more than one fan or not. Depends on how many amps total they draw. It does fit in a wall box.. I am looking to control the speed of a bench top grinder. would this item work for that application? It will depend on how many amps the grinder draws while running. If I remember right this switch is good for ten amps. A small grinder would work fine.. How do I know if I have a cap. starter motor? I have a small cage blower from a hot water tank. it is 110/220. I will use as 110. Not sure I understand what your saying. What do you mean by a \"cap. starter motor\"? But, you need to go by the amps on the motor. Make sure the motor is below the highest capacity for the controller.. Would you recommend this for a 2 Speed Range Hood (Electric Range) Fan to control fan speed? a rheostat is not compatible with a 2 speed motor. The motor will over heat and short out. You need a single pole, double throw switch.. How many wires to be connected? I have a regular attic fan motor with two wires (black and white). I connected 3 wires, hot, neutral, and the ground wire to the receptacle box.. ',\n",

You can use a pad there but it won't make any difference. This is a very poor product. My Review: I bought this in-store because of the no-filter reason alone. I have now had to throw it away and I am using Amazon to read customer reviews before purchasing online. I liked this for the first 2 months; the sound was noticeable but sounded like 'white noise', which didn't bother me. I followed the regular cleaning suggested by the manufacturer and thought all was good... until I noticed orange/pink mold forming in all the crevices I couldn't reach. I tried to take it apart (without disassembling the motor area, obviously) but there were still so many areas with the tint of color. I continued to use it and within about a week from this point, there was black mold spotted everywhere inside. I looked up how to clean it online and I came across the Amazon reviews. I noticed many people saying that this left a white film in the room and it finally clicked: Our wood furniture, baseboards and fan blades had been needing a lot of extra cleaning that I didn't think much about beforehand... but it's only in the room w/ the humidifier! I'll second all of the reviews on here expressing their opinions about how bad the white film and mold is with this product. The company wouldn't even let me return it without paying over $20 in shipping and they couldn't guarantee a refund/replacement.. the customer reviews complain about the noise it make is this true? If you set it on the lower and middle settings there is little sound. When it's time for cleaning you get more noise. This is my third unit.. It says 'whisper quiet' in description..is this true? Not true at all, it is very noisy and not efficient at all.. I saw a review to add the lemon juice to water to avoid possible Mold and Mildew issues (as PH level of water alters with acidic lemon)/ Any thoughts? I never had any problems with Mold and Mildew, but I did use those little balls that you can purchase for this unit. My biggest problem was that it left a white, chalky feeling coating on all surfaces within 3 ft. of the unit. It would take too much distilled H2O to got that route. I stopped using it.. the vicks is optional right? You don't have to use it. If you do, you use special vicks infused pads.. Is this warm mist or cool mist? Cool mist. I highly recommend getting a crane. They are awesome and so easy to keep clean!. I bought this humidifier. I cleaned up the base where the water stands and the tank with water. But how to clean up the top side openings? I own one and it is NOT difficult to clean. Initially I scrubbed the parts with ajax to get rid of the layer mold. It was difficult and took a lot of time to do... but later I realized if I soak the main three component parts in a bleach water mixture, there is NO SCRUBBING TO DO! It does a great job and the mold gets killed off by the bleach everywhere in the unit! After a few hours, just rinse the parts, that's all! No rubbing or scrubbing!!!. How do I clean the humidifier On the motor side only the bottom part with 3screws and the tube those you can take its out ,base and water container clean with vinegar .The motor I use air compressor to clean it. Use soft water as you can to avoid deposit Change the humidifier after 18 months. \",\n",

       " 'How do I measure ? I need one Large and 3 small... 10\" ~ 6\" Soobie, The drip pans, at least for a GE range, are sized based on the diameter of the circular openings in the cooktop. My small element openings on the cooktop measure 6 7/16\" in diameter--just less than 6 1/2\". To simplify things the drip pan manufacturer calls the pan to fit this opening a 6\" pan. My large element opening measures 8 7/16\"--just less than 8 1/2\" in diameter. The manufacturer calls the pan to fit this opening an 8\" pan. I would remove your elements and old pans, and measure the diameter of the openings. If they are like mine, then 6\" and 8\" pans will fit. By the way, these pans are of excellent quality.

       " 'As a DIY install, can the Evolution Compact 3/4hp unit replace an Insinkerator 1/3hp model w/o modifications? The first thing you should do is get the dimensions for each model and compare them. If they are close or identical in size it should be no problem. If they are of different dimensions or if you have installed a new sink where the drains are not in the same position (as I did in switching to an undermount granite sink), some minor reworking of the plumbing may be needed. Regardless, this should not be difficult. I picked up a garbage disposal install kit at Home Depot for about 15 bucks. It has a variety of PVC plumbing connections in various lengths and angles. You might have to jerry-rig some of the connections, but the kit comes with threaded connections and washers, so no PVC glue or primer is necessary. Just make sure you measure twice, cut once, and install the washers in the correct direction, and you should be able to make it work. I also found some excellent install videos on You-tube for my particular set up (double sink drains, with the disposal on the left side and the drain connection on the right). Good luck!. Does it need a threaded flange? I am considering getting a separate flange to math the finish of my sink. It fits units, 4-1/2\" diameter, 1-5/8\" depth Dear Jojo, I am not sure as don\\'t know the mount system of this flange you mentioned. The Insinkerator flange has two pieces and the bottom one, that goes under the counter, has adjusting screws so you can you can tighten both pieces against each other from both sides of the sink bottom. Please note the screws go only from one piece of the flange to the other not trespassing the sink bottom. The flange is for 4-1/2 drain valve sinks and the attachment of the Insinkerator is a \"bayonet\" type. I am almost sure all Insinkerators use the same mount type. If this flange is made for American garbage disposers it will PROBABLY fit. But I would check the compatibility with the flange manufacturer. He is the one that can assure you a 100% on this. I hope I have helped. Good luck.. whats the weight??? Don\\'t really know but it was lighter than the one I took out. I use a built up stack of small 2 x 4\\'s to hold it up and lock it into the sink.. While this product gets many 5* reviews - it\\'s the those with the unit the longest that are giving 1*. Can someone who has had it awhile comment. I had one from when I purchased my place and it started leaking from the bottom intermittently. Insinkerator was very helpful but noted that it was over 7 years old and out of warranty from the serial number I supplied. I purchased another as it is one of the quietest disposals I\\'ve encountered and figured it would be an easy replacement (and it was). Customer service also seemed top notch and actually called a couple times to help me with the old unit. Just another note as I look at the one star reviews, the basket on my original one did not rust nor did the impellers freeze into place. I\\'ve actually started disassembling the old one and don\\'t see much of any rust. There is some light surface rust around the impellers on the old and even my new one but think this is what one reviewer referred to as \\'cosmetic\\' rust as it\\'s non-scaling.. People have mentioned that water drains very slow with this disposal, will this be a big problem in a single bowl sink? (Have the Kolher Stages sink) Its true the disposal drains slowly, I have a single bowl sink.. does this use a wall mounted on off switch You need to buy a hako clamp or a Romeo to box connector and wire to connect to the disposal ~$10. The wire can be plugged into a switchable outlet under the sink. Good luck. Total cost estimate ~$200. I Bit the bullet as it will be my last, coming upon 80 yrs young!. After I installed the disposer, the sink does not drain unless I am actually running the disposer. Any ideas on what might be causing this? I agree this is an issue. Sorry, I don\\'t have the answer. Mine does drain but is much slower than when the disposer is running. It hasn\\'t been enough to be an problem for me.. needed SinkTop Switch? Yes you do!. How far from the top is the top of the drain output? Hi Sarah. It is 6 inches from te top of the disposer (the one in contact with the bottom surface of the sink) to the center of the circle that is the drain output. Please see image with measures here: http://images.insinkerator.com/pdf/evocompact_specs.pdf . Now, beware that because of the anti-noise external cover the space left to the wall inlet is a little bit reduced. I hope that helps. Good luck with your decision.. Is this the unit that operates with a wall switch? I don\\'t want the one that uses the switch in the drain plug. Yes, it\\'s hardwired from the disposal and plugs into receptacle under the sink which is wired to the wall switch to turn the unit on and off. The wiring and electrical connector do not come with the unit and have to be purchased separately.. ',\n",

You fill out a form sent with the iron and in a few days (surprising) you will get the head, then screw it on. No problems.. Is this suitable for use in Europe (240 volts)? I would think you need a converter since this a 120V product. You could check with the company to see if they make a 240V version..

I checked the document inside the case (I do not have the carton for reference) and agree that it indicates a 90 Day Warranty ONLY. My suggestion would be to pose that question directly to Wall Lenk since they have provided significantly varying information concerning their product. I\\'m not sure what the 5 year warranty stipulates, but I\\'m guessing it is very limited and probably not worth much. However, having published that information electronically, it could certainly be construed that their advertising supercedes the packaging and the internal paperwork.. What size are the letters?

       " 'How does the shutoff kit work with a steam dryer connected to water supply? This unit comes with the ability to connect more than one sensor. I put one sensor under my washer & purchased a second for under my dryer. I have a wye connector that splits the water going to the dryer and the washer. Should one of the sensors detect water, the solenoid valve will shut off. Once it shuts off, it will prevent water flow to either the washer or the dryer. A friend of mine did not have the shutoff kit & the hose going to his dryer developed a leak. Fortunately he was home & noticed the water flowing down the stairs to his basement. The sensors work as I tested each. I hope this answers your question.. Have recent purchasers received the older version (4x D batteries) or the newer version v4 (4x AA batteries)? Are there any other differences? Thanks! Apparently I have the \"old\" version (D cell batteries) but I\\'ve had the unit for several years and they\\'ve been no problem. I\\'d guess that they\\'re using more solid state components and so are requiring less power -- thus the smaller batteries. In any case the system works, and works well. I wouldn\\'t sweat the small stuff. PS - Also have the HWH system and have the same experience with it.. Do the valves need to be installed right side up to work? Do they still work if they are installed upside down? Has anyone installed them upside down? Yes, upside down or 90 degree will all work.. want to put one at the water main to house and put sensors under washer, water heater etc. but not sure the range of the sensors The sensor wires are not that long, approximatly 6\\' Not sure you would be able to use this on a water main. This model only hooks up to a hoes bib.. When water is detected, does this also shut off electrial power? If not, what happens to tub water if dain is clogged and machine is trying to empty No, all this does is shut off incoming water from the faucet. If draining and the drain is clogged, there will be water on the floor. To faciliate this, another type of sensor will be needed.. I know a sensor can be near a steam dryer to detect a leak-but how does the unit \"know\" that the dryer is getting water? Do u have to turn a switch? Water will flow through the unit until the sensor detects a leak. There is an audible alarm then as well as a flashing light. There is no water flow then.. Is this the newer v4 kit, or the old kit? Someone who has purchased this recently, please answer. Thank you! I purchased a FS3/4H90 v4 (version 4) which is lead free approx. 5 months ago. I do not know if this unit in the picture is earlier or later, my guess is it is an earlier unit.. Can these units be ordered without a sensor? I have extra sensors from previous project we can use. I have no idea. You would have to contact Amazon or the manufacturer. My feeling is, why not get the sensors? They can\\'t be that much more money and then you\\'ll have extra parts just in case.. Does this come with the new v4 controller listed on the Floodstop website? No. See the listing for FS 3/4H-90 v4.. thanks everyone! I was just asking because my hot water/ cold water hoses are upside down - so I think still clock wise just turn right to turn off :) I presume you are talking about the valves on the pipes coming out of the wall. If the hoses point up and the handles are on the bottom of the pipe, then, looking down at the fixture, you crank counterclockwise to shut the valve. It is an opposite action from your viewpoint. If you are still uncertain, then crank the valve handle to the limit of its travel in either direction. Then turn it the other way. If you suddenly hear water rushing through the pipe, then obviously it had been shut off and now the valve is open again.. ',\n",

I think it is just humidity but I will try and check that on the unit tomorrow and let you know.. Does it have a jack for external power yet? I have one of these a couple years old and the batteries don\\'t last very long. No jack for external power. The batteries last for at least 6 months. I recommend using rechargeable batteries.. Would you recommend this product for monitoring the humidity in a crawl space remotely? That is what I purchased mine for. I drilled a small hole in the floor of one if my closets to drop the probe thru and placed it where its easy to open the door and get a reading. Works great.. Does the external probe measure BOTH Temp &amp; Humidity? Yes, temperature, humidity and dew point are displayed. I really like it.. This ad says the 44815\\'s probe can \"extend on an 18-inch cable,\" how can I read humidity about 36\" away? Not with this device. Would this unit be suitable for monitoring conditions in an outside root cellar? I would think that depends on the moisture level (humidity). It would certainly work but if the gauge itself is in the same high humidity environment as the probe, it might not have as long a life. I use mine at ambient room conditions with the probe in a lab oven at 113F and 70% humidity. Works great but my gauge display is always cool and dry.. ',\n",

This merely sits on the drain opening; it has nothing to do with the inside. It\\'s merely a flap to collect debris and prevent it from going into the InSinkErator. You can push anything through it, but it stops spoons, etc. from falling into the InSinErator.. difference between splash guard and baffle No difference. This item does both. Very happy with item.. is this dishwasher safe? Yes, just put it on the top rack.. Does this Collar Sink Baffle fit Model Pro 333 disposal? I don\\'t know about your particular disposal, but I have an evolution septic assist disposal that I\\'m using this baffle with. Maybe you can cross reference the two but I thought all the insinkerator disposals used the same sink collars, so you should be fine.. So, is the diameter 3 1/8\" or 3 1/2\"? I see both answers, which doesn\\'t make sense since there\\'s not a size choice option. My InSinkErator opening is 3 1/2\" and this fit it perfectly when inserted from the top.. Can install the disposal with only this, and not the built on splash guard. That would make cleaning a snap. If I understand your question correctly, the built-in guard is part of the gasket between the sink collar and the disposal and must be used. If you do not install it you will have a leak. So both shields are used in conjunction with each other.. Do you think I can use this on a 15 year old insinkerator? I\\'d say yes. Mine was at least that old and no problem. It actually seated better than the one that came with the disposal. They seem to be pretty standard.. does it work with kitchen aid disposals I don\\'t know.

The diameter on this splash guard is 3.1 inches and slides down the drain opening in the sink. No need to detach disposer. My suggestion will be to take out your old one and measure, if it is 3.1\" then theoretically this one should fit.. dimensions?

I need something that will allow food to pass into the disposal but prevent kitchen utensils from doing so. Will this do the job? No, this item consists of a splash guard, which is left in place to reduce splashing when using your disposal, and a drain stopper for preventing water from draining from your sink. The item you need is this: Danco 9D00010051 Universal Disposal Genie Amazon carries this now (when I bought mine, they didn\\'t). If I\\'d bought this sooner, I\\'d have 8 salad forks instead of seven.

I bought a 20lb tank and got lucky when I drilled through the shell the first time. I drilled another hole for another add on and punctured the refrigerant lines. What did I learn from that? From the inside of the refrigerator cut the plastic shell with a box cutter. Use one where you can adjust the depth and only expose enough of the blade to cut the plastic. cut the hold large enough to expose the foam. Using a plastic spoon, stick, your fingers, just nothing sharp, scrape away the foam until you get to the metal outer shell. You may or many not run into cooling lines but if you do, you now have them exposed and you can drill from the INSIDE to run your CO2 lines. Learn from me and don\\'t blindly start drilling away. -edited for spelling.. Is a keg included? No. You will have to pay a deposit on a keg when you get it.. Say I wanted to put this under a table, yet run a tube thru a hole in the table, and have my tower/tap on the tables surface. can i do that? Yes but you would need lomger tubing and a way to close the seal on top of the kegorator to hold in the coolant (like a diaphram). If you wanted to keep the tap tower attached to the kegorator to avoid this, then you would need a taller tap tower as you would lose height running it through a counter top (iow, you wouldn\\'t have enough room below the tap tower to dispense a beer).. How easy is it to convert to a dual tap? Any recommendations on the dual tap to use? I easily just converted mine to a dual tap this weekend, and it was pretty easy. The tower I used was the \"Double Tap Draft Beer Tower- Stainless Steel- 3\" Diameter with Perlick Perl 525PC Faucets\" (you can copy/paste from within the quotes to find here on amazon). I Drilled through the top, and ran the hosing down through the original hole. As this is a plate chiller fridge, there \"shouldn\\'t\" be any refrigerant lines running through the rest of the fridge. Just be VERY VERY careful when drilling to not hit the plate inside the fridge (I nearly had a disaster with mine). Since the adding the new tower, I haven\\'t noticed any issues or changes with the machine. It still runs as often (and loudly) as it did before. PLEASE NOTE: Drill with caution if you pursue this route. I am not a professional, I just made educated guesses when setting this up, so proceed at your own risk..

Coors Kegs are a bit funky shaped but I have two Dogfish 60 min IPA\\'s in mine right now no problem. how do i set the regulator pressure when i turn on the tank it shoots up to 50psi and when i turn the adjustment knob it wont drop Close the tank valve off, pull the relief vent to relieve the pressure, open the valve on the tank back up about a 3/4 turn. The tank valve does not have to be wide open. Turn the pressure regulator valve counter clock wise to reduce the pressure to the tank. If need be, pull the relief valve and then slowly turn the pressure vale clockwise to increase the pressure to the tank. It may take a couple tries to get it dialed in.. C02 pressure too high Hello Danielle, 3-5 Psi is the correct answer. I am on my 8th barrel and this kegerator keeps working flawlessly.If you run it at 10-12 Psi as recommended it will be mostly foam for your first couple beers. 3-5 will be a slower but smoother pour. Enjoy! Remember you can always pull the ring on the coupler to lower the pressure instantly.. ',\n",

Yes they have the indicator strip and I'm pretty sure they are made by Broan.. Does the indicator strip to become colored all the way along when it's time to change? With my model of vent, the vent pulls from the center. As a result, the indicator strips typically change color from the center out (e.g. where the grease, etc. is being pulled up through it). I often rotate the filters halfway through use, and then replace accordingly.. serial number 010621222009 would this fit the vent ? I replaced the crappy filters that came with the unit (helped along by the USPS bending the damn things cracking the aluminum frame by cramming them in the mail box) with these guys. I don't fry anything on the stove top so they haven't seen combat, but still, they look brand new after a couple years use.. How often do you change the filters? It just depends on how often you use fan, I have been using mine since last October and they aren't dirty yet. love it. Do these filters come with the clips to hold them in place? Yes, the clips are included.. How can one tell if the range hood is ducted or non-ducted? When the fan is turned on, there's air blowing out from the front of the hood. If the air is coming from the hood, then you know it's NOT ducted. Ducted means the air is pushed through a duct to the outside.. What does Non Ducted mean? Non ducted means the air is not vented outside. It is circulated through these coal filter and put back in the room! So if your stove vent is vented to the outside you would not use these.. \",\n",
       " 'Why don\\'t reviewers mention the stove model that they were trying to fit? Remarks like: \"They didn\\'t fit my stove.\" don\\'t help much. I purchased these for a Sears Galaxy stove. These drip pans are a universal fit and as long as they fit under the grates you will be OK. The pans measure 6 3/4\" square with a 4 1/4\" center cut hole. The pans are basically flat on the bottom and could move slightly under the grates. So I really don\\'t think a model number means much as long as the grates are larger than the pans are square. Hope this helps you out. Also I still have the same drip pans on my stove I purchased maybe 3 years ago. The black coating is still intact.. my gas stove has 3 - 2 1/2\" burners and 1- 3 1/2 burner- will these fit my stove? yes, it should fit both. My stove has both as well, and they fit both sizes. Is this sold in packs of four? They are not sold in packs of 4. There is only 1. Also make sure you measure your burner area because these are just a bit too small for my stove. The piece that goes around the burner actually sat on top of this drip pan and they slide a bit. will this fit jenn air gas stove to replace rectangle drip pan?

Why is this listed as 42-inch hood but product details say 45\"? Which is it? 42 inches. It\\'s 42 inches wide, but what is the depth of the hood?

Is it really 20\" deep and 7.5\" tall? Those measurements are pretty close. If we don\\'t have duct, can we use this one? It really needs to be ducted. That is the purpose of the fan... to draw smoke and odors out of the kitchen. It doesn\\'t have to be an outside duct if you have an attic area.. Why is it listed as 42\" wide, but product details say 45\"? Someone else asked me about this. It must be a misprint. My hood is 42\" wide, exactly, and has functioned perfectly.. ',\n",

The water cutoff from the wall is a tee, so one side of the arrester connects to the top of the tee, and the other side of the arrester connects to a flexible hose, which in turn, connects to the bottom of the toilet tank. If you currently have solid copper tubing between the cutoff and the toilet, I would replace it with a reinforced flexible hose.

Lowes doesn't have a direct part for this. plumbing help please! I used a Mini-rester to correct a water hammer caused by one of my toilets. I have a Tee water valve coming out of the wall. I turned off the water and removed the copper tube connecting the water valve to the toilet. I used the silver side of the Mini-rester to connect to the water valve. I threw away the copper tube and replaced it with a re-inforced flexible hose to connect from the brass side of the Mini-rester to the toilet. I did not use a compression fitting.. Since changing my toilet tank filling device from the old floating ball to the newer type with the float on a vertical shaft, I have a water hammer problem. Can I put a hammer arrestor somewhere between the wall mounted water outlet and the toilet tank. Yes, that is exactly what the mini rester is designed for. It is how I it installed. I unscrewed the tank line at the wall valve and screwed the mini rester onto the value output and then the line attached to the mini rester. The copper portion of the mini rester can be oriented vertically or horizontally (mine is horizontal). For connecting to supply lines under a bathroom sink, should I be getting a 660-TR1 or a 660-TC1? Thanks!

       " \"I have a plain concrete driveway, could I use this to pour over the existing driveway to get a design? Ergo: The weight of a vehicle? As to the concrete and the weight of the vehicle, you will need to use a concrete thats rated to meet that requirement. You would also need to poor it deep enough that it wont chip off or crack. The design would be the easy part of it all and after just completing my project and where you are wanting to do this I would suggest turning this and using it as more of a stamp and not a deep cut. So by turning the mold on its top and using it as a stamp without a real deep cut like a path walkway you get the look of the stone and it looks great. You can really get a professional look without anywhere near the cost. I don't know how to post pictures on here or I would. I poored a large area and worked the concrete just as you would for a smooth surface then went back and stamped the area. I am staining the concrete this weekend. I hope this helps. I have sloping yard. Can I use this in a way that I can create thicker blocks on the sloping side so that everything in the end is level? You know- cost wise- you are better off making a regular plate and shoring it up with dirt or rocks. BTW- I collect pretty stones etc and embed them in mine- also have a special one that has the grandkids handprints with ages on it.. How do you fit it into an area that is not the exact dimensions of the cutout? ex area needed to be filled is 48 inches by 37 inches. I had a similar problem...I made the mold on plastic on a flat surface, my driveway. Then I broke apart the squares into the 8 separate pieces and like a jigsaw puzzle arranged them till I finally got them to fir. How thick and wide is the outside border? The outside frame is about 2 inches high and 3/8 to 1/2 inch wide. It's quite sturdy as you have to compact the cement into the form and it appears strong enough to reuse for mulitple projects.. Has anyone done different colors in the separate sections with the quickrete liquid cement color? If so, was it hard to keep the colors separate? though coloring the concrete might seem an easy task, getting a consistent color is not. Personally, I set with uncolored concrete, and after it has cured I use concrete stain....turns out great, and gives you more control over color, and patterns. Would it be better if you made these first and let them dry so you can tap them in place in the sand to make them level I don't think it's a good idea. hard to make it level for such a big surface. the point to use this is you don't need sand level, so save you work and money.. how many square feet does the form cover? It's 2' x 2'. Could I use this for a driveway? Would it hold the weight of a vehicle? No, the stones would shift under the weight.. Is it recommended to put gravel down before setting the pavers? In my opinion, that would be best. However, as long as the ground is level and compacted it will be fine. I didn't use gravel because that would have required more digging..

If you own the twin tub or are considering it you need to understand that it is NOT an automatic washing machine. Your typical automatic will fill, wash, drain, spin, rinse, drain, spin, an then repeat the rinse cycle without any intervention from you. This machine is different. You control the filling of the machine with the faucet, you control the length of agitation while washing the clothes, you move the clothes to the spinner, you drain the wash tub, and refill it for the rinse cycle.

On a hot summer day on your boat? hell no. mine sits on a shelf, used it once to see if it worked - haven\\'t used it since- probably never will. complete waste of money. if shipping hadn\\'t been 40 bucks, I would\\'ve returned it. oh, and to top it all off - it makes like 12 cubes at a time so if you aren\\'t making ice ahead of time and putting it in a freezer there\\'s no way it will keep up with even four people drinking any cooling required drinks - on the fly, that is.. Is the inside able to be cleaned due to the constant flow of water and it will grow mold and become unsanitary?? The only place you do not have access to is the water tube that moves the water from the storage tank to the ice maker itself. Everything else you can easily clean. When not using it, I recommend drainin the water and leave the lid open for a couple days to dry it all out.. Does the small setting make the soft ice like you get at Sonic? I have only used the medium and I think the small would be the same shape of cube probably but just smaller. I can tell you this though...usually how this thing works is that it makes the ice and when the cubes are first made they are kinda hard but by the time that the bin is more full...when you take out the cubes they are nice and soft and perfect for people like me who like to eat ice without killing their teeth. The shape of the cube is like a bullet with a hollowed out center so they are easy to chomp on if that\\'s what you like but not too soft so that they melt right away. I let mine run all the time and it makes ice till it runs out of water and it has been working great.. Its not a freezer unit, so if not used all day the ice will melt and go back into the system? Do the ice cubes ever get stuck together in a clump? Yes, a little bit but they are quite easy to break apart because the cubes are slowly melting. It\\'s not that bad really. It\\'s not like a frozen bunch of ice that you have to break apart on the cement. Its no big deal really.. Size of machine?? Size not the problem doesn\\'t make very much ice. It\\'s good for maybe 2 3 people and doesn\\'t keep up if you want to use for long period of time.. do it use a lot of electricity if left on all the time No only because I never leave small appliances pluged in and on not even the coffee pot. can i attatch a water line to the unit for automatic water refill? No. Where do you get Parts We haven\\'t had to fix it so not sure but would check the manufacture\\'s website. http://www.edgestar.com/. does it have a basket or bin for emptying extra ice into freezer? A basket not very big and does not make ice very fast. Good for maybe 6 glasses. I was wondering if the ice is hard enough to serve to my guests for their drinks. I don\\'t want soft ice, it has to be hard for the drinks? Thanks Julie OK we drink a lot, Vodka on the rocks works fine for me. I would not consider it as \"hard clear ice\" but because of it\\'s cupped shape it produces ice very quickly, if you use the small setting you get dense ice. Cheers. ',\n",
       " 'Just got mine out of the box. Is the ice supposed to be hollow, half-tubes?

Does this make \"sonic\" ice? also called pearl ice, soft ice It\\'s not chewable, however; not as solid as if from a freezer.. How much ice does the bin hold? I\\'m guessing- 3-4lbs we love ours.

Ice machine.. how well insulated is storage bucket I leave ice in it for a couple hours...but it isn\\'t very frozen when I dump it into my freezer. It often clumps together Once dumped in my freezer due to it having started melting. Also if I use the ice straight out of the bucket it melts fairly quickly if its been in the bucket for a couple hours. If you dump it quickly the ice is fine. I don\\'t think you could leave the ice all day and expect it to still be chilled. A few hours at max.. What is the water source for the ice? You have to either fill it up, but I think it also has a connection like that of an ice maker for a fridge. We\\'ve had problems with the fridge automatic ice maker line always leaking, that is why we bought this and we fill it by hand. Several things to note, if you don\\'t know them already; it does not keep the ice frozen after making it, you have to empty the bin when it is full. It takes awhile to start making the ice, but once it gets going it really puts out. We\\'ve had ours about 3 1/2 years and the automatic shutoff for when the water is empty and the ice bin is full has stopped working, but that hasn\\'t been much of a problem, we just keep an eye on it, make a bunch of ice and put it in a large ice bin in our freezer.

Like I said they are wonderful and sent me a new machine it arrived in 4 days and cost me nothing. Capacity: My question is how much ice can the unit hold before you need to empty it? ROUGHLY 1/2 GALLON, SEVERAL CYCLES WORTH.. Keep ice frozen? Does this model keep the ice frozen, or does it all start melting as soon as it\\'s made? its starts melting at first, and then the whole unit cools down, any ice that melts goes back into the pool of water used to make the ice. After the unit gets going, the ice melts very slowly, you won\\'t be disappointed. If any ice melts, the unit just keeps on making ice so there is always fresh ice in the unit for when you want it.. Does it produce the clear ice as advertised? Yes, the ice is clear unless you have a lot of air in your tap. Then it will freeze whiter with the bubbles.. ',\n",
       " \"what is the thermofuse? It's also called a thermal fuse and is located in the back of the dryer on the blower house. When the dryer overheats the thermal fuse cuts off the electricity to the heat source and the dryer. The thermal fuse can't.be reset and must be replaced. Clogged vent tubes full of lint and or debris are usually the causes.. Will this fuse work with the Kenmore Elite H3 electric dryer model 110.82822102? It should since it matches the part number here (I searched your model#): http://www.repairclinic.com/Kenmore-Dryer-Model-11082822102-ID-596836-Parts Good luck!. I have an old lady kenmore 11078890800 they have discontinued the part is there a compatible fuse I can use or am i out of luck I really don't know. I found all info on troubleshooting on YouTube. All info on compatible parts were google searches. The part is cheap can't hurt to try good luck.. Does it have a positive side and negative or does it not matter ? NO. It is just a fuse with no polarity.. Will this work for a Kenmore Elite Dryer Model number 110.8787? Its all about the part # that is on the thermocouple if its a match then yes cause Kenmore and whirlpool are made at same place just different name. My dryer goes for a few minutes and then shuts off. It will go back on when button is pushed. Code E 1 Agree? No. will this part work with Kenmore model gas dryer 110.74622300? Not sure I have a whirlpool. will it fit med5870two maytag More than likely. Will this work for a kenmore gas dryer model # 110.97572601 Yes it work for myself it should work for u as well. What temperature does it turn off at? I'm not sure. All I know is the dryer works and I saved over $100. I bought three of them, although of the dryer goes out again, I will probably replace it since there must be something causing it to over heat. I'm hoping that cleaning the air duct tube fixed that.. \",\n",

       " 'Does this humidifier have auto shut off when the water tank is empty? Yes. Does it make white dust? Yes - if you have hard water. White dust will come from any ultrasonic humidifier that is used with mineral-laden (\"hard\") water. The dust is actually the mineral residue from the water, just like the salty coating you would see in the pan if you boiled salt water until it was dry. I have soft water and do not have a problem with white dust. The key issue with white dust is the water, not the humidifier.. Does it soak the surface you place it on? This is the third winter I have used this humidifier. It has not gotten the top of my dresser wet, not once. This is the first humidifier I have used that did not make the surface wet. Be careful when taking the tank off the base and putting the tank back on the base. I find it easy to do. One hint--make sure the gasket is flat before screwing the lid back on. Then don\\'t tighten it too tight.. how often do you change the filter? Once a year. Does this humidifier produce the nasty \"white dust\" caused by minerals in tap water?? I completely disagree with Eugene. Product is well made, quite, easy to clean and fill with water. Very little to none on the white residue. I do recommend this unit.. Does this use filters ? I was looking for filter free cool/warm humidifier ? Yes, it requires filters. One comes with the humidifier and the first one lasted about 6 months for me.. we can\\'t stand any lights in our bedroom at night....does this have any lights on it that can\\'t be turned off? The indicator lights are very bright and if you\\'re sensitive to that try applying a piece of black electrical tape over the light. I have the same problem with a B&D hand vac.. How easy is it to thoroughly clean the inside of the water tank? Every humidifier I\\'ve every had became slimy and mildewy, and most of them had areas Very easy. The unit comes with a small brush tucked inside the water holding tank. I also use a wet paper towel on o get mildew out of corners. Curious if everyone is using distilled water? I only use distilled water and like you I was running to the store. I bought a used Water Distiller, Countertop, White Enamel, Glass Collection on Craigslist for $50, the new one runs over $175. It took me a few months looking to find it. My suggestion is to check Craigslist or ebay once a week if you don\\'t want to spend the money for a new one.. how to clean SPT-SU-4010 Humidifer? I just use vinegar, to loosen the deposits, and a brush (they supply a nice little brush) on the base. You can, however, purchase special cleaning fluids for humidifiers if you prefer. For the tank, I use a dilute hydrogen peroxide solution just once a year, usually at the beginning of the season.. ',\n",

I only need the slightest excuse, (the electronic panel going out,) to replace it...and I' won't replace it with an LG. Seems like I can smell rubber burning or getting hot? Could be the large gasket or roller inside. The gasket is awful to replace.. How Do You Drain the LG WM2016CW Washer? I plan to do this once a month, but even that is a lot of additional maintenance that I didn't have to do with my old washer. :( Anyway, my questions about draining: How much water will come out of the machine... thanks for posting this and following up on it. i'll add this to the monthly to-do list.. Is this stackable with the lgdlg2526w I stacked my LG washer and dryer so I could fit them in a closet, but I don't recall which models they are. You do need a stacking kit. I'd also recommend a drain pan under the washer.. I can't see any water when washing or rinsing. Is it cleaning my clothes? Yes, it is as long as you use a detergent that is made for high performance washers. It's quite amazing how these new washers get your clothes clean. Whites seem to be the only issue. They get clean, but they loose their brightness over time. You can check the performance of the washer by soiling a hand towel with various stains and letting it dry for a day or two before you wash it.. Powder or Liquid Detergent? Which is better to use? I just purchased and installed the WM2016CW washer. As a complete newb to the front-loader universe, I set out to run the first load of laundry. I was rewarded with water and suds all over the floor. I called customer service in a panic and the rep told me I probably added too much detergent. Fair enough. Crisis averted. She then went on to lecture me that the WM2016CW is not meant to be used with liquid detergent (even if it's HE). She said it should only use powdered detergent. I referred her to the manual and LG's own website which explicitly state that you can use either in the machine. I'm not sure who to believe, but according to at least one LG customer service rep, the detergent of choice should be powdered.. \",\n",

Note - One time I ordered the filter, which appeared as you see it but actually received a round one.. how/shen do you need new filter ? If you're using tap water then know if it's alkaline. The higher the alkalinity, the more often you will need a filter, every 3 to 6 months. If you use filtered or reverse osmosis water, then a filter will last 8-12 months. This also allows the mist to circulate in the air longer. This is what I do and it reduces costs of buying filters.. i need the part that fits on top where the mist come out where and who may have this part? You can get this directly from the Supentown website: http://www.sunpentown.com/paacforhu.html SU-4010 nozzle, part 20019. How long does the filter last if used with distilled water? I just use tap water. unit water stays very clean with the filter. It says to replace every season so I do. Don't know if it would last longer.. Can I skip the filter and just add water treatment to it instead. The filter does not work well on it's own. Mine works fine! I probably will buy another one soon. I Think you have to use this filter in order to work properly.. Will this work in a surround air 2500 humidifier? I am guessing not as it only mentions SU-4010 on the box.

Do you need such a large converter to travel with?. I am using the transformer for a kotasu in the US. I have blown 2 fuses, and the transformer came with a blown fuse. Is the transformer defective? I would be hesitant to trust a Kotatsu with a 500W transformer. Anything that is supposed to generate that much heat could easily pull more than 500W. If the Kotatsu is rated for less than 500W and has a max draw of less than 500W, then yes, it could be a transformer issue, but for something like a kotatsu, I would have gone with a larger transformer to be safe.. Would it be safe to plug in a JP powerstrip into this or should I buy two of these? Two JP devices into JP powerstrip into transformer into wall Should be fine as long as the two devices together do not exceed the wattage of the step-down. It\\'s good to leave head room, so if the two devices together are under 400 watts (4 amps) you should be fine.. is this unit regulated and linear? I will using it on an electrostatic energizer amplifier (Stax srm-323s) I use it as a step down for my stereo amphlier. It was made for the Japanese market. The fuse on the unit you are looking at is 5amp. That is all I\\'m qualified to say.. I have a high end japan cassette tape deck, its says \"100V, 24W, 50/60 Hz\" it is the right converter? Thanks Yes, it will work for your cassette tape deck.. The output socket for 100V seems to be Europe standard, while Japan plugs are US standard. How it works with Japanese appliance? Japanese standard is different from US standard and it works with Japanese appliance.. hi can I remove that screw in the middle, because I have Power adapters that might touch that. You cannot remove the screw because it is holding the grounding metal strip. Are there supposed to be instructions inside the box? We didn\\'t get any, just the basic \"read warning before operating\" instructions on the box . There were no written instructions in the box. The incoming voltage switch and the power outlets are clearly marked. You set the incoming voltage switch on the back, 120V for American and 100V for Japanese, then you plug into the corresponding outlet on the front to match the voltage of the device needing power.. What\\'s the spec of replacemet fuse? 5 amp. Can I connect a Hitachi refrigerator to this unit? The compressor is 89W/Defrost element 139W. Absolutely! I use this for my coffeepot @ 500W... ',\n",

No worries, it will fall off of the wall within a few weeks. If not, you can rip it off, along with the paint below it. 0 stars.. What do you use on the item to be hung? Whatever you normally would with whatever type of hanger you would use normally. The hook part is the thing that's out of the wall, so the stuff just plops onto that instead of a nail.. Would it hold a mirror of 10-12 lbs ? II plan to put it on the wall, above the sofa. The mirror just has one hole at the back. yes if it is new installation. Can these be used on a solide wall or only dry wall? I think only drywall. Can it be installed in the drywall encasing sliding doors? If you are referring to pocket doors, I don't believe so. The majority of the hook is in the back side of the wall. Most pocket doors fit pretty snuggly, so I don't believe it would work. Sorry.. I'm looking for something that will stick to the ceiling and hold a lamp. Will this work? Definitely NOT NOT NOT. That is for a picture. I usually use something like OOK 50330 Jumbo Swag Hook with Hardware, White or a swivel hook. And try to put it in a beam by screwing it directly in. Easy that way. Just put a tiny dent in the ceiling to get the screw started. and tighten it. When it gets hard to tighten, use a screw driver and lever it in between the screw and turn it around and around until it is all the way in. Got to be a beam or piece of wood in your ceiling.

       " 'my washer is 27.5 wide and 27 deep will my washer fit My new Maytag Bravos XL is 27 wide by 27.5 deep and it fits nicely with extra room. The sides do slope so the overall dimensions are not really giving you the exact space available for your machine. I just measured which is a bit difficult with the machine in place. The inside dimensions appear to be around 30.5 x 28.5. We placed the washer with a couple of inches to spare in the back. You don\\'t want to have extra in the front or you will be likely to step on it which over time might crack the plastic. I was very happy with the quality of the pan.. Does one install this by lifting the front end of the washer, sliding the pan under and then lifting the back of the washer to finish the job? The entire washing machine will need to be lifted up first on one end and then the other. Not to difficult. I lifted up the front end first. Then, slid the tray underneath the washer as far as I could. From that point, I slowly adjusted it into the pan. Then, lifted up the back end with no problem to the side wall of the pan to slide/moved slightly side to side onto the pan.. how deep is this ? , i need 2.5 inch or more height for my side outlet drain this would be perfect for you. It has a cutout on the bottom, and on the side so you can pick either. I used the side for my house setup. Mini washer fits my front loader good. Would this pan (with washing machine on top) slide over carpet easily? I assume you want the answer to be \"NO!\" :) It\\'s hard to be certain without trying but my *guess* is, no, it won\\'t move around. The washer is heavy and this isn\\'t a slick, easy glide bottom. If you also add a vibration dampening mat under the tray then you may get still better \"adhesion\".

Not sure I use this on my sink for drinking water and it removes the foul taste in the water soy guess would be it would give you clear ice. Do I need separate filters for my kitchen sink water and my ice maker line or will one filter both? It depends on how you are plumbed. If you have a single line which does both, you only need a single filter. If you want to know about volume, the filter is rated for a specific number of gallons. You will have to use your judgement as to how much water per day you are using. Good luck!. my water line for ice comes from underneath the house. can i just hook this up with compression fittings to the line that's behind the refrigerator? Yes you will most likely need some additional fitting however start with the kit and add required fittings Home Depot or Lowes or Menards should have the fittings. Does the kit include hoses? Tubing is not provided with filter system. You must purchase your own tubing. Filter head is furnished with tubing quick connect fittings.. Does this kit include all parts that are in the US-EZ-4 kit minus the faucet? Yes, it has the filter and the base mounting hardware. All that is needed is the water line in and a water line out.

It can only be vented from the top. Although, charcoal filters can be used to recirculate.

How much of an energy load (watts or amps) does this range hood put on an electrical circuit. Based on Broan\\'s website, it\\'s rated at 2.9 amps.. Do you need the liner or can it be used without? I\\'m building a custom hood to fit in a 30\" space. The simplest solution is to use the liner. Just make sure the controls are to front. The 390 is really quiet and the lighting is very good. Bob. Can this mount in the ceiling soffit above a range? Yes, I believe so provided the dimensions fit. Although it does not require outside ductwork, it does need to be vented into attic or have a return air vent. It\\'s worked extremely well for our needs. I had read that if you do heavy stovetop cooking, such as wok-type, a different system would be better. The only other thing I can think of is that your soffit might be too high for effectiveness. Ours is 32\" above stovetop. They had a model set-up at Lowes that might help you decide.. is it ventless or does it need to be vented It\\'s designed for a vent. It has an 8 inch outlet with a flapper valve to prevent downflow when the unit is off. You may be able to get a recirculation kit, but I vented mine, so I don\\'t know for sure.. ',\n",
       " \"Stupid question...does this hood come with a motor? My parents are insisting that for the $, it can't come with a motor -- that it is just the hood! yes, fully functional and running as we speak. Dos it include power cord or must that be purchased seperatly? No, it does not require a power cord. You have to wire it in to the existing connections.. is everything needed for operation included with this unit? Yes,it can be vented horizontal or vertical,with the included hardware. Very good unit for those of us on a budget. Arrived well packed and undamaged!. \",\n",
       " \"What bulbs does it use? You can use A15 40W bulbs if you don't want to use Halogens. Halogens are too hot for me. I started out with the incandescent A15 and saw some LED bulbs at Lowes or Home Depot (Utilitech - Pro , model LR140M/LED). They are 4.5W, 300 lumens and made for use in a damp environment. They are not cheap but the lighting is very clean.. Is it hard wired or plug in? You can wire the fan either way. It just depends on what you have for the electrical connection now. The connecting wire is not included with the fan. I used the one that was already installed with my old fan. It has a normal 3 prong plug. Since the plug and wire don't move once the fan is installed, the old wire was like new.. Does this Broan QS230SS come with air filters? Picture does not show all details. The QS23OSS comes with a single, stainless steel mesh grease filter-- easily removed, cleaned and replaced-- but no air filter per se. We have had very good use of the unit for nearly two years, with one caveat: for several months, both lights came on, but then one would go out. After awhile, it seemed to correct itself, and that problem has not recurred. Advise against using halogen bulbs, as they take a lot of wattage and get very hot.. I had the hood installed to be vented to outside. Air blows out the top vents. Very loud clicking on 3rd speed. ???? Call the person who installed it and have them fix it. They most likely did not remove the blocking panel that opens the hood to the outside vent. The instructions are pretty clear that you need to do this or else it will simply blow air back in your face. The clicking is probably a similar issue - that your installer didn't open it up and put the right panels in place and remove the securing packing tape.. hood vent out back? It can be vented out the back or thru the front.. Does this model have the damper included for the seven inch duct. The fan comes with a 7 inch duct plate for you to attach the duct to the fan. There was no damper included.. Can an extended warranty be purchased for this product? Accompanying literature indicates a one-year warranty period. Many credit card companies extend warranty periods on items purchased with their cards; I would suggest investigation.. I've had my vent hood for about 3-4 months. This morning it started making rapid-fire clicking noises (nothing turned on). Anyone had this problem? We have been using this hood since 5-13. No problems. I don't think it is electrical but turn off the breaker & see if it stops. Remove the filters & look in the exhaust. Use a flash light. Start & stop the fan. Unfortunately I have no further ideas. Hope you find it. Let us know.. my cabinets will allow 30 inches wide. will it fit? i bought th white and it fits perfectly.. Do you have to used a duct. No, you have an option to use it ventless or vented. Very pleased with the product.. \",\n",
       " 'Is there any hardware (such as screws) included in the package? I am aware that the light bulbs and filters are not. Yes. There is a small package with everything in it. My husband missed it. They are on the side in the cardboard. A woman can find it. :). Are the bulbs included? Do we have to buy separately? Thanks! Bulbs are not included. You\\'ll need to buy them separately. On Amazon I bouught (2)-Sylvania #14700 50-watt PAR20 wide flood halogen bulb. They light very well on low setting, and extremely bright on high setting.. Does this seem quieter, louder, or about the same as other range hoods you have used? About the same...nice sleek look. Are light bulbs LED ? The unit does not come with bulbs. The fan is quiet. I am pleased with this purchase bought in November, 2013.. How \"brainless\" is it to turn the light / fan off? I like simple pushbuttons for \"off\" so I can jab at it, no thinking. How EZ are rocker switches? It is so easy to turn off or on, I do it with my eyes closed.. Is this really 10\" from top to bottom? I like the quiet aspect but if it\\'s really 10\" thick, it won\\'t work above my range. More like 7\"--I measured it. Is it 100% Stainless steel? I have seen so called Stainless units that have only the walls in stainless and the top of it is not stainless and rusts. It is 100% stainless steel.. Is there a way to fasten the back of the hood to the wall. Is there a way to fasten the sides of the hood to cabinets sides\" This model was meant to be fixed from the top. You could probably drill your own holes for a side installation and in the back for more support. It could be done but would be a pain.. Does it come with the filters? Finding info on the web that says it does..but others here are saying it does not. It does come with the reusable filters if you are going to vent it, but not with the charcoal filters if used not vented. Installed range hood on Dec. 27, on Jan 5 it blowed one of the lights, do you have any ideas why? Unless there was an abnormal voltage surge, it would have been the light bulb that was bad. Halogen bulbs get very hot and if the seal for the bulb is weak. the expansion and contraction from the heat would cause a leak, leading to a failure.. ',\n",
       " 'What are the dimensions. Buyer beware as there are a TWO different filters being sold under the SAME basic HC-504 nomenclature. The original/good version is 1.25\" thick, whereas many of the more recent offerings are only 0.75\" thick, therefore with MUCH less moisture-delivering efficiency/life, yet at the same price. Worse yet, often the images shown in Amazon are dimensionally proportional to the original/good ones but what they really ship is the inferior version - I know because I just returned six filters to Amazon but got stuck with shipping charges and wasted time. Someone else suggested another source (filters-now dot com) and I\\'m sending them an inquiry based on the above.

More often if I used humidifier in summer months.. Which Filter is to be used in Honeywell HCM-350 This filter will work. I have the same humidifier.. Honeywell is a US company right? Yes, Honeywell Inc. is a US based company. Honeywell Home Environment products (such as fans, heaters, portable air purifiers & humidifiers) that you see at retail are manufactured by a company called Kaz, Inc.

I\\'m using this filter in our Vicks Starry Night humidifier. I like these filters more than the Vicks replacement and the Protec ones are junk, even though they appear to be made by the same company.. Is this compatible with the Honeywell Easy to Care Cool Mist Humidifier HCM-710? according to the box, yes this filter will work with the HCM-710 series. What are some compatible filters in this size? according to honeywell, homedepot \"Fits Honeywell models HCM-1000, HCM-2000 and HCM-300, 500 and 600 series\". What filter fits the model HCM-710?

I looked up the your Honeywell model 6011i and it specifies it uses a HC-14 replacement filters. So in my opinion I would say no, it is not the correct filter. Your humidifier looks taller, and this particular filter is shorter, so I would look for the correct replacement filter on Amazon which should be an HC-14. Hope this helps!. what fits the model HCM - 890 There are 2 filters that I know of: Honeywell HC-888N and HC-888-TGT. The second one is the better, more expensive, filter; but either will work in the HCM-890 Humidifier.. ',\n",

Thanks This small refrigerator really needs to be raised up by means of some kind of base, otherwise you\\'re on your knees looking into it. I happened to find a suitable nicely made wooden crate at an estate sale, which I cleaned up and painted and which serves perfectly. Brings it up about 12 inches, so I can access it more easily and comfortably. This fridge has never leaked except when I defrosted it and left the door open--that was completely my fault. I think you could just put it on a slab of plywood cut to size, if you wanted to use it in a carpeted area--though even this may not be necessary. Hope this helps. It\\'s an excellent little refrigerator. I\\'ve had mine nearly two years and I love it.. My dorm limits the amount of amps to 11 or less. How many amps does this fridge use up? This is a very nice fridge/freezer. At start up it ran at 4.6 amp. Once it reaches temp, it runs at less than 1 amp. You will be very happy with this appliance. With the seperate compartment, you get very little frost, too.. Hi, I\\'d like to order this for my daughter who will be heading to college next month. Is there a way to purchase and delay shipping? Buy the HD-113F Kenmore from Sears. It\\'s the same refrigerator, (both made by Midea, and branded with their own logos) but Sears provides a MUCH better warranty. They also have layaway and local service to help your daughter in the event she has some repairs or needs to return it.. Is the Freezer Frost Free? If I recall correctly the specs said no.

Yes it does fit interchangeably on the left or the right. The only way you will ever be able to tell the difference is if you use one side of your stove more than the other and clean that pan more or less than you should. Funny!.

I suggest measure the wholes-however, they did not fit my kenmore-I put allum-foil under stove top. If you can go into store near by and see if could work. good luck.. What are these drip pans made from? GE says there should be a difference between the left and right because of the curvature at the top outer corners. These are metal, and pretty heavy-duty metal at that, so if you were wanting to trim them to fit, I don\\'t think that will work. Mine turned out not to fit due to the area between the two holes not being molded to be high enough, so you may want to get all the measurements before you order.. what is the internal diameter of the opening?

The UEi test instrument has its measuring sensor inside the end of the instrument and can only measure the moisture in the air going into the sensor. To measure the moisture in the wood you need a probe that would go into the wood. The feature that makes the UEi instrument so usable is the rapid response of measurement of temperature and humidity.. Does this model display wet bulb temperature? No ,only dry bulb and % humidity. But it is fast.. What if I put it at 0% or 97% relative humidity, will it break the hygrometer, or is it just not-measurable? I have used these within the range of about 10 - 98% RH. No problem. I don't think it will break and it will definitely measure.. Is this accurate for reading body temperature of people? No. The probe is not designed for coming in contact with anything and is enclosed in a plastic cage.. Can this measure differences between points less than 6 inches apart? As long as there is a measurable variation at each of the points , yes it's dynamic and changes the instant a variation occurs.. Does this display temperature in degrees celsius? Yes. The button below the On/Off button toggles the display between Fahrenheit/Celsius. It also has Hold, Min/Max, and Reset buttons.. What's the % accuracy of these? Amazon descriptions are not the go-to place for specifications, as usual No information on accuracy, but the initial reading starts out higher than it ends up if you wait a few minutes.

These Samsung filters used to fit no problem, but now the filters I used to order (still being sold in same old boxes) don\\'t--the sprockets on the neck have been redesigned and do not match the picture on the package. I have not found a way to order the correctly-fitting original filters from Samsung.. Is DA29-00003F the same as DA29-00003G? No, the \"F\" and \"G\" are identical in fit only. As for filtration, the \"F\" is strictly an \"aesthetic\" filter, meaning that it filters out chlorine taste, and cloudiness only. The \"G\" filter, on the other hand, is a \"health\" filter, meaning that it filters out cysts, chemicals, and heavy metals (lead, mercury) contaminants and so-forth. The \"F\" is a waste of your money. Pay a little bit more to protect your health, and stick with the \"G\" model. By-the-way, don\\'t purchase any of the cheap, off-brand filters as they are every one the equivalent of the \"F\" model Samsung Aqua Pure filter. Buy only the name brand \"G\" model Samsung Aqua Pure filter. I have researched this extensively, and am a retired RN with 30 years experience, and very extensively trained, and well-read, so I do know that of which I speak about. Hope my little lecture helps! :-) Michael. This filter works great and is very easy to install. But, I\\'ve noticed when installing the filter that the marks on the filter NEVER line up with the \"lock\" marks on the fridge. Does this happen to anyone else? Filter goes on EASY, but I\\'m always... Here is the answer we got from Samsung tech who was called to the house when the new fridge water tasted terrible. The filter has to be inserted and turned to catch, THEN PUSHED UPWARD AND TURNED TO ENGAGE THE FILTER COMPLETELY. Then the arrows will line up. We knew something was wrong when there was no water in the original filter when first removed. Apparently, the guys who installed the fridge never fully engaged the filter, and I followed their lead. The filter works perfectly now. We were also cautioned about \"generic\" filters that are knock-off quality and not able to filter as well or as long. There are duplicate Samsung filters made in Korea that are low rated but look exactly the same. Genuine Samsung filters with a higher rating are made in Mexico. Hope this helps.. locking symbol does not line up but seems to fit correctly other than that and water flow is fine. Will this affect the quality of the filtering? they work just as good as the big box store ones do but not at the box store price. I need to replace my water filter for my samsung RF26XAERS side by side fridge--will this work? I would not recommend these filters. I ordered the 3 pack and 2 of 3 never worked. See my recent post from me and others on the many, many complaints. Even after flushing 5-Gal through the filter there was a terrible chlorine taste. If you do purchase I would get them from Lowe\\'s. You will need to find your model number which is inside the door. GOOD LUCK!. I purchased my Samsung a year ago. I just hooked up the water line and the replacement light came on? Why did it expire when I\\'ve never run the water? The replacement light simply runs on a timer so it is likely just a coincidence that it came on now. There are no sensors that measure the quantity of water through the filter or quality or water output. Simply reset the filter reminder on the panel and wait till the next time that it comes on to replace.. Is this made in China? According to the labeling it is made for Samsung by the 3M Corporation in Mexico.. Does it come sealed in plastic from factory like the one from purchased from Samsung does? If I remember correctly it did. Have had no issues with it whatsoever.. Is this model compatible with samsung RSG257AARS? That\\'s my model too and it works great.. Instructions say to turn off water valve before installing, meaning refrige would have to be pulled out from enclosure each time. Is this true? That\\'s a good question. I must have missed that in my reading of the instructions. I have changed 4 since I\\'ve had my fridge and I\\'ve never shut off the valve. I simply untwist the old one, pull it out, line up the marks of the new one to the housing, and turn whichever way the arrow says to until it locks in. Then I \"run\" the water until it flows like its supposed to. The only other guidance I have is to check your fridge manual for the true directions. Best of luck!!!. ',\n",

No. Will it work with a electric baseboard heat in one bedroom? It is designed for multi stage furnaces . I don\\'t think it would work with simple baseboard heat. I would go with a basic thermostat. But I\\'m not positive. You may want to Google basic thermostats... Will this thermostat work if you only have central electric heat and a central AC as in a mobile home. Not sure about working on a mobile home ac. I bought it to use on my York heat pump unit. My problem turned out to be the electronics in the air handler.. Will this work with a 2-stage Bryant AC/Heat gaspac? The thermostat the dealer installed is programmable and we don\\'t need it. Yes , this tstat will work on your hvac system. If you dont want to use program, just push the hold button.. how easy is it to install From a \"hardware\" standpoint, there is literally two holes that need to be drilled and the thermostat\\'s BASE is fixed to the wall, then you connect each wire accordingly, and then you fix the thermostat onto it\\'s base. That\\'s it. Obviously you will need to know how to hook up the wires, a good idea is to take a photo of your previous thermostat\\'s wiring prior to removing it. From a \"configuration\" point of view, the thermostat needs to be set up to match the equipment that you have (number of heat sources, Celsius or Farenheit, etc.) , however default values will work for a conventional cooling / heat pump unit.

If for water or ice I recommend the lvl 4 filter. I have crappy water and it makes my ice taste much better.. I have the EZ1 right now. Should I get the EZ4 instead for better filtration? I live in NYC tenement buildings built in the early 50s. I have the EZ 1 cartridge currently. When I replace my filter I will move on up to the EZ 4 just because it filters out more contaminants.. What size tube? 1/4 ID or OD? I see conflicting information in the responses. Local supply store has both next to each other. OD. Will this unit work if it's mounted sideways in a cabinet? I realize I'd probably need to support the end of the filter, doing this to make sure it's level and no side load maybe causing a leak. It's very difficult to get my side by side out, I want to... My educated guess is yes it will. Since the unit is under pressure at all times, and it doesn't leak when sealed, it should work in any position.. I have a culligan IC-102 filter on fridge, will this replace that filter? waterfilters.net has Culligan filters. Call them at 1-888-801-7873. They probably have your answer.. I'm looking for crystal clear ice cubes does this filter do that? Yes, but to an extent. My water here in DC is VERY cloudy and after installing this filter only a little tiny section in the middle of the ice cubes were still a little cloudy, but still a HUGE difference using this filter.

I manage a Distribution Center for a large college campus, and we stock these for our campus plumbing shop, to be used as replacement hoses for washing machines installed in our faculty housing units, and we have had no complaints with these. We have been replacing the old rubber hoses with these as the rubber ones wear out, or break.. How long have you had your hoses and have you experienced any leaks or leaking fittings? We have had he hoses for about one year. They are attractive and apparently well made. Not much to go wrong. No leaks so far. Leaks occur primarily at the rubber gaskets, which are inexpensive items that are easy to replace.. What is the length of the hose? I can understand your asking this question as product description is anything but straightforward. The size displayed must be the shipping package. That said. These come in varying sized. You can get lengths from 4\\', \" WMS4-C000674 \" up to 8\\' \" WM96SS \". Keep in mind this is for one hose. If you require two ,one can buy a two pack. This particular model is 5 feet in length, \" 2PBSPW60-1212 5-Foot Stainless Steel Washing Machine Hose, 2-Pack \". In most application 4 feet is sufficient.. Do you get a pair or just one hose for $12.88? One hose. Does the hose have an inlet screen? Yes they do. I find very necessary when dealing with water that may contain particles.. I have a weird need for a extremely flexible hose (OUTDOORS). Does anyone have a guess if this will hold-up well outdoors? Weird I know. In my opion it would work. I would keep it from the direct sun light though and keep this flex hose relaxed do not put it under any kind of strain as it will need to expand and contract with temp changes. Hope this helps. When you get this hose make sure it is a Watts product it will have a red lable on it with the Watts name.. does this hose have a plastic hose in the center? Rubber on the inside with the braided outside for strength. What is the length of this hose? I can\\'t find it in the listing. Am I missing something or did the seller fail to state the length? 60 60\" long.. ',\n",

       " 'What re the countertop cutout dimensions? In preparing a cutout in 1 1/2\" thick plywood which will be wrapped in stainless steel, I made my very loose fitting (~1/4\"+ unit movement) cutout 19 1/2\" deep and 28 1/2\" wide with 1 1/2\" radius curved corners. The stove base has 4 screw attachment holes at the corners to secure the unit to the countertop. It is recommended that the curved corners be located with respect to the depth and width lines and cut first with a circle cutter before cutting the remaining depth and wide cuts.. Can anyone tell me what the surface dimensions are 30 by what? 21 1/4. Can anyone tell me if the stove top gets hot while the burners are in use? I read one complain that said it got hot 1 to 2 inches around the burner. We have not noticed this happening.. With the controls can you turn them without pushing down?

It appears that the cooktop is completely flat other than the burners themselves making it really easy to clean? Is that the case? Yes that is the case.. Do you have any issue with the grates sliding around and/or do you see issues with the glass getting scratched up over time? no, not having any issues with the grates sliding around because they are pretty heavy. As far as the glass scratching we just lift the grates straight up to avoid that problem when cleaning. The only issue we have had so far is the knobs. They are good quality but in removing them to clean we have lost two little rubber inserts which holds the knob steady on the male inserts that they attached too. Now two of the knobs are loose. i need to get a hold of G.E. to get replacements. I hope this addresses any of your concerns.. \",\n",
       " 'Does this hood wall exhaust through the top? Is there an exhaust kit available with this model? The hood includes the exhaust mechanism, filter and light fixture, and once you install it (under a cabinet or all of the way to the ceiling) you must purchase the necessary exhaust pipe to either take the exhaust straight thru the roof, or get a 90 degree elbow (and the necessary pipe) to bend it (in the attic) in order to take the exhaust to the (side) eve of the house. Exhausting to the eve of the house is more economical and reduces the cost/risk of cutting thru the roof and the potential water leak etc. The elbow and aluminum exhaust pipes that I purchased at Home Depot (very economical) do not have to be sealed since they fit into one another tightly. One thing that I noticed on my hood is that the light switch occasionally stick when I try to turn the light on. Although I have not done it, I am sure that a bit of WD40 sprayed on the side of the switch would do the job. Considering the cost of this product, it is an excellent value. The unit is very easy to install. We are retired and we would buy this item again. We have stainless steel appliances and this hood matches seamless. To impress family and friends there are other hoods that would do the job at higher costs. I suggest that you follow the installation instructions as far as the distance of the hood from the top of the stove. Too close to the top of the stove will impede your working room, too far from the top of the stove, will diminish its power to exhaust the heat properly. It was suggested to us, and we followed, to install the hood where the very bottom of the hood is in line with your eye brows. It works fine, as exhausting the heat/smoke and it gives us plenty of working room with the pots etc. I hope this info helps...... The depth of my cabinets is 12 inches will this hood fit? Yes. Should fit perfect. This Broan undercabinet range hood takes a 75 watt bulb. Standard base? Will a CFL or LED physically fit in that space? i currently have an led bulb in mine. Do you need to buy a power cord? No. What all is included in the hood for $75.33? All the hardware needed to mount the hood as well as the blower fan. The light was not included. It was easy to install and looks great once installed. Very good quality hood for the price.. does this have dishwasher safe filters? Yes. Aluminum grate filter can be washed in dishwasher.. Do you know what is the hight of this range hood? I need range hood with only 5 inch hight. 5.75 inches height.... Is it necessary to have a power cord or is this hood typically hard wired? hard wired.. Can this ducted hood be wall mounted without a cabinet over it? no, it anchors to the cabinet at the top. what is the diameter of the duct per your picture ? The product image is not the product you are purchasing. Read the description instead of looking at the picture, this is a 3-1/4x10\" rectangular top exit. I made the mistake of buying this thinking it was a typical 7\" round duct based on the picture, it is not.. ',\n",
       " 'Can you confirm that this is the left-side hinge? So the door pull is on the right side, as in the picture? great question L after the 24 means left hinge, exactly as the picture shows.. Is the lower portion SOLELY for wine or could it also store cans, bottles, etc? either, you can adjust the temp but the shelves are wine style. Many people put cans and bottles on them. What is the height of each shelf? I read that you can store 3-liter bottles on the top shelf? The height is 6\" between shelves(with some adjust ability on a track) however the top shelf is recessed back about 7 inches so you can stand a large bottle on the lower shelf and it wont interfere with it. They are adjustable as well. Keep in mind this is a beverage center so the lower half is all wine and the top is a smaller compartment for soda, beer water etc. Looks like with some adjusting you could fit a 3 liter I hope this helps...

       " 'Which filter to buy??? What is the difference between this PUR filter 4396841 for $35, the cheaper Pur PBSS one for $29 or the 4396710 for $35??? If all the filters are original PUR* replacement filters, the filter medium will be the same. Someone has posted that the PBSS filter is inferior to the others, but I see no data to back up that assertion. The difference is in the amount of water they can filter before recommended replacement and the flow rate. The \"universal\" PBSS filter is rated at 100gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396710 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396841 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.85GPH flow rate. Strangely, both the 100 & 200 gal. capacity models are recommended for 6 months replacement. You would think the 200gal. models would last longer. Some whirlpool refrigerators offer what\\'s called \"fast-fill\" systems, which dispense the water almost twice as fast as \"normal\" systems. It stands to reason that the 4396841 would be best if you want/need the higher flow rate. It also stands to reason that the lower flow rate models probably filter better since the cartridges (and presumably the filter mediums) are exactly the same size (educated opinion). I have decided on the 4396710 for my refrigerator. I researched a lot for this answer, I hope it helps.. Kenmore refridgerator: Does anyone know if this model works with the Kenmore refrigerators. Thank you so much! I\\'m going to check my manual to see if it\\'s a Fast fill product or not, although the Refer. is a side-by-side.....I\\'m paying over $50./filter now through Sears\\'s website, but won\\'t now!!!. Filter 4396841 and 4396841P which is the difference? The P stands for pair and the T stands for triple pack!!! Thanks to the participants to the discussion. :) The P stands for pair and the T stands for triple pack. Same as Thermador REPLFLTR20 is whirlpool 4396841 the same as REPLFLTR20. The number I have is 4396710 . Can I use the same 4396841 PUR Push Button Side by Side Refrigerator Water Filter I agree with Brett below. In looking at the picture of both, they look the same, there a 2 nipple ends that go in first. On my Fridge(Whirlpool Gold Side by Side) there is only one way to slide it in, so it is impossible to insert incorrectly. The filter is slotted to match up with the filter hole in the refrig. See answer found online: Important note: The filters 4396841 and 4396710 are interchangeable and offer the same level of filtration. However, the 4396841 offers two flow rates (0.50 gpm and 0.85 gpm) which are necessary in some applications. If your refrigerator has a \"fast fill\" function in your dispenser, you should use 4396841. Otherwise, the 4396710 will work properly.. does this filter fit amana Here are the compatible part numbers. You need to check your current filter number and see if it matches. The genuine OEM Whirlpool / KitchenAid 4396841 Refrigerator Ice & Water Filter replacement fits Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Amana, Jenn-Air, and Kenmore side-by-side refrigerators with a push-button filter located in the grille at the bottom of the fridge. If you see the words \"Fast Fill\" or \"PUR Measure\" on your water dispenser, stick with this filter (4396841) because 4396841 has dual flow rates of 0.50 gpm and 0.85 gpm. If you don\\'t see those words on your dispenser, you may upgrade to the newer, improved Whirlpool 4396710 filter. The newer 4396710 filter removes more contaminants than the older the 4396841 filter, including cysts and turbidity.

       " 'Lint filter: Does anyone knows where I can purchase the black filter behind the white filter and filter cover? This is the review that helped me: \" 4.0 out of 5 stars Great dryer! The filter does get clogged though...., March 6, 2012 By Benjamin D. Garlock (San Francisco, CA) - See all my reviews (REAL NAME) Amazon Verified Purchase(What\\'s this?) This review is from: Haier HLP140E 2-3/5-Cubic-Foot Compact Tumble Vented Dryer (Kitchen) I\\'ve had a great experience with this dryer and the washer that pairs with it. I live in a tiny studio apartment in Manhattan. The only problem is the wool filter in the back eventually becomes way too dirty to be useful. Even using the lint wand, it eventually just gets too chewed up. After a good deal of digging I found that you can replace the filter. If you Google the part number it is called a \"Panel Top WD510023\". They were about seven dollars with shipping. Other then that, it\\'s a great dryer! \" I\\'m going to go and look up the part.. How to vent this dryer? I\"m thinking about getting this dryer, but i don\\'t know how to vent this dryer.I live an apartment and I dont have an exterior vent.Do I need buy vent kit or not? I totally agree. There\\'s no need to vent this dryer and i don\\'t even use a \"Vent kit\" I just place it up again the wall and use the adapter that comes with it to vent up from the back. The filter\\'s screen makes it so little if no lint get\\'s out. In the winter it\\'s a free heater and humidifier, in the summer your central a/c should have no problem keeping the house cool. It put\\'s out very little heat in the long run and if you just wait to you go to work/school to turn it on then it\\'s literally no bother.. Capacity question? Can I dry bathrobe, two queen-size sheets, large jacket in this dryer ? You can do 2 bathrobes, queen size sheets or even a jacket. I have found that i can do 5 or 6 pairs of pants at one time or even a small blanket. All things considered as long as your willing to wait for it to dry you wont have a problem with any of those. The dryer is more forgiving than the matching washer.. Electric bill: Did you notice a huge electric bill jump when using your portable dryer? Considering i do 2-4 loads with the washer and dryer combo a week i really didn\\'t notice a change in the bill, in fact it was negligible increase. One thing i do that others may not be able to do is i wash a load or 2 before i go to sleep with and toss the wet laundry in the dryer and wait till i leave in the morning before i turn it on. When i leave in the morning i turn the A/C off anyways so even if it increases the temp and humidity in the apartment i never notice it. Coming home turn the A/C on and fold clothes and everything is good. If it helps you the dryer uses about as much electricity as a hair dryer or a space heater (My kill-a-watt says between 900-1000w during use). The matching washer uses literally a fraction of that. I also use auto dry instead of timed dry and have never had a problem with it. But more to the point after one full load from my 1cf haier washer i used about .75kwh or about 9 cents to dry it.. i heard it stop without the buzzing. since then, it is rotating and gets hot, not as loud or effective? I\\'m sure it should ~not~ be doing that. (I guess that was obvious.). I have had my dryer for 9 months and recently the drum stopped rotating while on. Any suggestions on how to fix this? I personally have not had this issue, but sounds like drum belt is loose or broken.. rug Not sure what the question is, but I would not suggest putting a rug in there unless it is a small bath mat.. vertical window vent kit? listed Haier AC-3940-81K window exhaust kit, will this fit? Yes, this will fit.. does anyone have a rattling noise? 2 years old and i have never replaced belt or filter. love the machine. traditional dryers can easily get rattling noise if something small gets sucked into the filtering process... but This one I doubt that is much of an issue, I\\'ve had mine about that long, and I don\\'t have a rattling noise. Try slowly rotating the inner drum, and see if something \\'moves\\' inside (aka... drops b/c it was ontop of the drum or something else, or something inside the inner \\'bumps\\' that push the cloths). How many watts amps? Can I run HLP140E Dryer &amp; HLP21N Washer together on same 15 amp outlet? You need to ask an electrician. I just plugged mine in to a standard American 110 wall outlet and it works great. Oh and both washer and dryer run and works on the same outlet at the same time.. ',\n",

According to my humidifier parts catalog, your model calls for 4 filters - each 6 1/4 inches high, 11 inches wide and 2 3/4 inches thick. These are only 2 3/8 thick. I don't think this will be a problem. When I replace or sell filters to customers, I always try to measure the filter holder to see if the filter will reasonably fit. This filter type is flexible and will swell when wet. Good luck!. I have 3 EssickAir 696 units. The replacement wick is supposed to be part # 1041. Would this wick work in my unit? According to my replacement catalog all models of the Essick Air 696 -400 and 400HB use the Essick 1041 filter. I confirmed this with one of my part houses. Please remove the water bottles and check how many wicks your machine uses. Depending on the exact model, some use more than 1. Is a wick type humidifier soppose to set in the water? yes. \",\n",

       " 'Can this be used in other brand humidifiers? It is only for the Venta humidifier.. Is it common for this not to work.. even after being just a few days old? I am still getting white dust all over my electronics and such. No this is not common. I have had my Venta humidifier for 4 months and replaced the cartridge once and have not had any issues or white dust. I would contact customer support. Good luck.. How often is the filter cartridge supposed to be changed? My humidifier did not come with a manual and I can\\'t find one online. Can anyone help? i change mine every year.. Where to insert the cartridge? Can\\'t find screw-in place. Thanks. on the model that I have the filter screws onto the inside of the water tank fill cap. remove the fill cap, unscrew the old filter from the cap and replace it with the new filter. Should be simple. Be sure to follow instructions for activating the filter.. why did my humidifier stop emitting vapor? I change my water every few days, wipe it down and the change the airwashers when it is due. Mine have been working over 2 years.. Is an airwasher the same as a dehumidifier? This is a filter for the Venta Ultrasonic Humidifier. That\\'s what I am using it in. Believe they are using the term \"airwasher\" in how the filter helps remove particles, dust, and others from the air.. Does anyone else\\'s humidifier emit blue water after s/he puts in the replacement cartridge? It is turning my entire tank of water blue for some reason Angela, When I replaced mine with the filter here, there was no discoloration that I noticed. Maybe the filter\\'s reaction to the water quality you added, but I\\'m unsure.. ',\n",

One way to get an answer is to call Sear's 800 number to talk about water filters. Have yur old filter to look at and refer to. Get the exact numbers of the treplacement yu want from Sear's. Then check back with Amazon. You will no doubt find, as I did, that you can buy th filter you want thru Amazon at a big saving.

It did fit our Kitchen Aid Unit very well, along with the turning blades. The parts that I ordered from Amazon were relatively inexpensive, but certainly did the job and our expensive Kitchen Aid mixer has been working very well and that makes my wife very happy.

Please only answer if you've tested/compared it to other devices and/or local weather stations. THANKS The humidity reading on my old unit that eventually failed got funky and was reading about 30 percent lower than what it should have been. But the replacement unit I bought over a year ago has been right on the money so far. What's weird, however, is that the humidity reading INDOORS on my MAIN unit has gone bonkers now and is reading about 20 percent less than it should be. So go figure. But I have a digit-readout humidifier that I use in the winter, so that's not as important to me as the temperature.. Can the sensor get wet? Live on south side of a apartment, but our mail box faces the north. Am I correct, the most accurate reading is from North? Yes. I've had my sensor outside year round, from 90+ to -25. In extreme cold I've noticed a problem that it changes from degrees F to degrees C but other than that the sensor works great.. does this work with older (12 years) Oregon Scientific radio controllers Find the model number of your base unit, and then check the Oregon Scientific website to see which sensors are compatible. http://www.oregonscientific.com/us/en/service/sensorguide.

One question for those with color White: is it made of stainless steel too (just painted in white)? Not made of metal, I hope? Thanks. I have the black one, so feel free to discount my answer. I \"think\" my black one is painted metal, instead of painted stainless. Make sure read my earlier review in case my experience helps you.

If I remember they will fit four different sizes.. What are the different colored round \"things\" for and do they show or do they go underneath the knobs? Thanks They are to make the knobs fit,but the knobs kept falling off even with those.. Do you have to hold down the IS button or does it stay on after you press it one time? They did not work on my stove,. do you have replacement knobs for hotpoint stove? I am so sorry but at this time i do not. towertree*58. will this replace a (700854-4 part no.) jenn.air knob? If your buttons need to be pushed down to turn these might not work. We have a kenmore. And they did not work for to that reason. Can the knob be oriented with \"off* at 9 o\\'clock rather than 12 o\\'clock position? i couldn\\'t use these knobs at all and actually broke one trying to install. they look like they fit, but when you press down to turn, it only works the first time. what a waste of money. i should have return them but. Will this fit on an older GE stove? The original GE stove knob requires a push in, then turn. Don\\'t know for sure but they come with adapters that I used.. will this fit Thermador (OEM: Bosch) older cooktop? Hi if your old knobs pull off, then yes these should fit.

       " \"What are the fiting sizes on this? I have the filter aboard my boat (which is under cover for the winter) but as I recall the fittings are standard garden hose connections. I use it to fill the water tank on my boat because the water line from ashore sometimes has algae in it from being infrequently used and subject to sunlight and warm temperatures.. does this RVF rv water filter come with a filter ? Answer here...You can buy replacements even at Walmart.. are their connection replacement (male &amp; female) for culligan rvf-10, water hose connections? No. could not find any at home depot etc.. Will this housing hold the d 20 cartridge ? The only cartridge listed in the instructions is the D-15. So I would say no.. What is the temperature rating on these? Can they be used to filter water from the water heater? We always used ours from the source to the rv, so temperature was never an issue. The water was heated after it flowed through the filter and into the rv. I think you would want to do it that way, because then you minimize or eliminate any dissolved salts in the water before the water heater.. HOw much does it reduce the water flow... RV already has problems with pressure after you put limiter on inlet. I didn't put a limiter on, and there was no difference in the flow pressure. But that could change from one campgrounds to the other. Hope that helps.. could i use this product to avoid water spots when rinsing my car? I doubt that it would eliminate the possibility of water spots when water dries in the car without using a towel. Depending on the filter type used it certainly would reduce the particulate matter that is left behind when water dries but it would not turn the water into the equivalent of distilled.. What does the 5 year warranty cover? Wanted to make sure it covered the parts along with the housing. Honestly I do not know. However, several years ago I had the female connection break and they sent a replacement free of charge. But I since have replaced both the plastic female and mail ends with metal ones. The reason...we RV a lot and I felt more secure since we hook up and unhook the filter so frequently. Otherwise I do not see any reason for the unit to not last way more than 5 years. We have been very pleased the filtering system.. Could you tell me if the inlet and outlets are 3/8? I can't recall, but I will say they are plastic and leaked horribly even when I used Teflon tape. The inlet house simply blew out twice so I to modify with connectors purchased at HD.. \",\n",

Specs say item fits 1 3/4\" door, but flat part of bottom piece is 1 1/2\" and then there is a 1/4\" bubble. Is door suppose to sit on bubble? Yes the bubble will be under the door on the side that faces out of your home. It is there so you do not see a gap from the outside.. How much of the bottom of the door itself is covered on the side without the screws? None.....just the weatherstripping.....but it\\'s below the door. I want to keep my foster kittens from going from room to room; I want to cut the strips to fit the folding doors. Can I?o The strips can be cut using a utility knife. The strips are made to fit an exterior door, so they are about 1 and 1/2 inches deep. That might be kind of deep for a folding door.. What is the location/spacing of the screw holes? Holes are 8\" on center.. does this come in 32\"? We don\\'t carry.. ',\n",
       " 'how long does beer stay fresh? how often do you have to change CO2 and where do you buy those? do smaller kegs stay fresh longer? how/when do u clean? A tapped keg of beer should stay fresh 3-4 mths. You can get the co2 same place you buy kegs. Bought the kegerator Dec 2013 we have averaged 1 keg a month and we have changed the co2 tank once. I bought a cleaning kit same time I purchased the kegerator and we have cleaned it just once, I believe we should of cleaned a little more often. We love thr kegerator works great and keeps beer cold.. Does the temperature easily adjust? I need it to hold it at 50-55 degrees is there a setting for that? It\\'s not quite as simple as a set and forget digital setting. Yes, I believe it will be able to hold your temperature range of 50 to 55 degrees. It will probably be able to do that without having to disassemble the thermostat too. You will need, however, to monitor the temperature until it gets to your desired range. I have one of those atomic clock things that has an outside temperature transmitter. I just put that transmitter inside the kegerator. Mine keeps track of the temp range in the past 12 hours and resets at midnight each day. I just went down and checked mine. Now, keep in mind that I actually have mine set to keep my beer in the mid 30\\'s. I like cold beer! Anyway, the range of mine since midnight last night has been between 31 and 38 degrees. It was precisely 33 degrees when I just checked. It holds that pretty consistently day in and day out now that I have my dial set correctly. By the way, it is a rotary dial, with \"colder and warmer\" direction. There is no temp set. So it may take you some trial and error but I think you should be able to get there pretty quickly. Hope this helps.. Is this unit including a keg as pictured ? No, the keg is for illustrative purposes. However, it does include everything else in that picture.. Can you put the CO2 tank inside the kegerator or does it have to be mounted on the back? With 1/6 of a keg it will fit. I have seen home made kegerators with the tank inside. Tape the hole in the back so no cold air gets out. Enjoy. using the biggest keg this dispenser can hold how long will it take to empty using 12, 12 oz servings a day The biggest dispenser it will hold is a full keg which is 15.5 gallons. If my math and measurements are correct, it will last 13.77 days.. Will this fit a full size leinenkugels keg? We\\'re wanting summer shandy all summer. To be honest, I don\\'t know what a leinenkugels keg is... if it is a standard 15.5 gallon keg it will (barely). In fact, on all of the 15.5 gallon kegs, I had to either tape the door shut or in one case, make a tape seal around the door because the door would not close.. I\\'d like to convert the beer line for use with corny kegs. What size barb fits the beer line? The beer line has a nut that is pre-attached that screws on to the coupler that attaches to a standard sized American beer keg. This link may help explain it better visually. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uBwEDDoYY0 I hope this helps.. Does the temperature easily adjust? I need it to hold it at 50-55 degrees is there a setting for that? Bought this as a wedding gift. It is pretty much the same as a mini fridge. Dial for temperature, like 1-7 was the setting if I remember correctly.. Does this hold the standard normal keg? I drink keystone 1/2 kegs and im not quite sure what they mean by Does NOT support use of Coors, Miller rubber No It does not. From front to back its only 12 1/2 inches. The diameter of the quarter and 1/2 barrels are 16 1/8 I use a 1/6 of a barrel its 55 bottles and lasts me 2 weeks. Plus it only weights 58 pounds.. does the unit have an energy guide sticker that estimates energy use for one year, like refrigerators do? Don\\'t know yet. Delivered as a gift out of state. Did you try their web site? There\\'s also a number of sites that rate these devices, so they might include energy info.. ',\n",
       " 'will this strap block the TV from tilting backward too? No it only helps with tilting forward.. Will these straps also prevent the tv from falling backwards into the wall? Using museum wax underneath the front of the tv stand prevents the tv from falling backwards...used in conjunction with the straps to prevent the tv falling forward...it gets the job done. The strap kit I purchased at Home Depot comes with 2 oz. of museum wax to serve the purpose of the tv falling backwards. Museum wax is a microcrystalline product which provides instant grip to collectible items, etc. Sticks to wood too! :). Is this worth the money if you can\\'t use the bolt to put into studs in the wall? So just using adhesive? Our walls are plaster &amp; lathe. We anchored our tv to the tv stand,not the wall. It works.. Will the adhesive work with a brick wall? Hmm... I wouldn\\'t be entirely confident in answering that. I dont believe that it would be effective on a porous surface.. Is this strong enough to keep a tv from falling over if the tv stand it is on is being rocked/shaken by a energetic toddler? It is very sturdy, however if the stand itself can be rocked or shaken I would secure the stand as well. We have a very large tv on a stand close to the ground, our toddler can pull and shake on the TV and it holds well. I\\'m not sure I entirely understand your situation, but I hope this helps!. Can I use this for a 65\" tv ? Yes. I have bought this product before, and would now like to buy just the \"sticky\" pads. Can you refer me to the right purchase option. Thanks I\\'m not sure about just the adhesive pads coming seperate. I checked the quakehold site and couldn\\'t find anything. I would suggest contacting quakehold directly, or looking to see if the adhesive company 3M makes anything comparable. Hope this helps!. Can the straps be attached to WALL with adhesive rather than screwed in? Yes but it\\'s better to screw it in for a stronger grip in my opinion.. Can these safety straps be screwed into the wall rather than the TV stand? Yes Much better that way. Find stud locations and use lag bolts 1- 1/2 long. My TV is a 51 inch flat screen and sits in a corner on a glass tv stand. Is this a solution for me? I don\\'t think so. You need to screw the base into something. Mine is on one of those Ikea \"wooden\" cabinets.. ',\n",

Can an electrician install this or do you have to use Ge. This will be replacing a previous GE induction cooktop which lasted 15 years. Same installation as the old one and does not have to be GE installing it.. Is this downdraft ventilation? No you will need desperate ventilation. However remember you don\\'t have the open flame heat like a gas stove so less ventaltion is needed just to remove smoke or orders. I just have a microwave above with vent and it is perfect!. I\\'m replacing a 30\" JenAir glass cooktop and we have granite counters. I\\'m worried the cutout won\\'t match exactly- what size will this require? You can look up size requirements for opening on a G E help page. Oft hand the sizes are very close. Does the stainless steel trim get scratched by the cookware (vs. a model without the trim)? Yes. We have had ours 9 months and have a small number of scratches. They are almost not noticeable.. The electrical wires coming out of it do not look copper to me - they are silver in color. Does anyone know if these are copper or aluminium? Not sure but the electrician that installed it didn\\'t have any issues with them or use any special connectors. Hope that helps.. How easy is it to clean? Does food get struck in between the cooktop and stainless steel trim? It\\'s very easy to clean. Just make sure you use the proper cleaner that\\'s called out in the manual or you could scratch it. We love our stove top.. My wife is concerned that she will break a glass top / smooth top cooktop. Is this a concern? I also was very concerned as I had never owned a glasstop or induction either. After severall months of cooking on it I would not have a concern. Ijust removed anything I had around the stove so nothing would be dropped on it. Even the cookwear is heavier than most and no problems. I think this is the future cooktop and gas will be out! So fast and efficient even frying is easier and faster. If I would have know how wonderful it was, I would have purchased it years ago. Its the absolutely best change in my kitchen remodel. GO FOR IT!. How much voltage is required. 120v or 220v? 220V. The stainless steel trim appears to be raised. Does this require extra care in positioning the cookware, or limit the size of the cookware bottom? It is raised so your cookware cannot hang over the edge. We really haven\\'t had any problems with this and we use large stockpots. If you use a large pot on one of the smaller cook surface you may have to set it off center a little which isn\\'t an issue.. ',\n",

I live in high heat vent on one end, directions say allow 3\" clearance back, top and sides for air circulation. will not hold proper temp in over 110F or under 0F. is this freezer self defrosting Sadly no... but I have it and it works perfect!. Where was this GE product manufactured? General electric Appliance park Louisville. Made in China. Does the compartment on the rear that the cord comes out of, have a cover? Mine doesn\\'t.. THe dimensions are 24x29.3x32.4. Is that length, width(depth), height? depth (incl hinge) is 22.5\" Width (across the front) is 28.5\" Height (not including legs used for adjusting) is 33\". ',\n",
       " \"What is the warranty? we didn't send it in.. What is the voltage 110 or 220?? 220. Some say it's 110 and others say it's 220....so which is it? I need a 110. It's 220.. Hello, Is this product plug in or does it need to be hardwired? Hard wired only.. Is this a 110 or 220 plug? 110. You have to actually wire it yourself as it doesn't ckme wired with a male plug.. \",\n",
       " 'Do these cooktops require 220 outlet? Yes - but hard wired in a junction box, not a plug-in outlet. Install instructions specify a 208/240 V power supply. However, they also say 40 amp and that would only be needed if you were using all burners at max heat at the same time. I had mine hooked up to the same 30 amp power supply as my old \"regular\" electric cooktop with no problems.. Can an electrician install this or do you have to call GE? My electrician was here to run an electric line to the island so he very quickly installed the cooktop. Be aware that this cooktop isn\\'t a perfect square. If you already have a cut opening you may have to chalk the gaps.. I need to get the candy mix up to a 310 degrees F. Will the new induction cooktop make things that hot? Absolutely - candy was one of the first things I made on my cook top!!! (and needed to go to a hard crack stage.) It gets much hotter, also - if needed. I LOVE the \"H\" setting - brings water to a boil very rapidly. My one suggestion - get the 5 burner if your counter will in any way accommodate it. When we got our induction cook top, I\\'d never even seen one or knew anyone who had used it. My husband said, \"Get the 5 burner\" - I didn\\'t want to, as I\\'d never been short on burners when cooking, even for groups. (I was always running out of oven space so we did get a double oven - reg. sized - LOVE it!) Well, even the sales person didn\\'t explain to me the advantages of the 5 burner; it\\'s more than just a burner. With induction, it is more important to match an sizes, but . .more importantly, you can only use \"H\" (the energy boost for rapid heating\" on one burner at a time in a section. On the 4-burner cooktop, there are 2 \"sections\" (I am sure there is a technical term for it) - on the 5 burner, there are 3 sections - so . . you can put more burners on \"H\" at the same time, and yep - I needed to one day when cooking for a crowd. Of course, you make do with what you have - but I sure wish I\\'d gone w/the 5 burner for the times I need it. And . . I LOVE the \"L\" (lowest) setting - holds things perfectly, and I no longer need to melt choc. over a double boiler. I just put it in the pan on the stove -L setting. And .. I while many pans will work w/induction, I\\'d recommend the best you can afford. We have been very frugal our entire lives - and did buy Demeyere pots and pans. LOVE them - (even when I had to cook on a coil hot plate while the kitchen was being remodeled.) Worth every penny - and if you get them at Sur LaTable and don\\'t care for them you can return them. My husband loves them!. What kind of pots and pans are suitable for induction cooking? they need to made of metal that a magnet will stick to. Our current cookware is produced by infinite circulon. a coated cast iron works as well as some stainless steel. my suggestion is invest in cookware that is recommended for induction cooking.. Can I put the GE Profile convection single wall oven below this cooktop? Yes GE does approve for this oven to be installed below this cookbook. However it can\\'t be a different brand or gas. The oven has to be a GE brand. How this helps in making your decision.. Is the cooktop surface scratch resistant? - something similar to the glass that smartphones use these days? We bought ours in 2010 and no scratches so far - and that\\'s with a LOT of cooking. We use cast iron a lot, but always put a paper towel under it when we cook as an extra precaution not to scratch it.. How much room is between the two 81/4\" burners? Can I fit two 10\" pans on those burners at the same time? I just tried it and there is not enough room for 2 10in skillets on the rear burners probably 2 pans will fit.. i would like to put a drawer for spatulas, spoons, etc. under the cooktop and over the pot drawers--is that possible with this model? The unit will \"stick down\" into the cabinet below the cook top about 6 inches. It is not possible to have a drawer in the \"normal\" position immediately under the unit. It is much the same as your kitchen sink in that regard. You could have a tip out drawer in front of the unit similar to the kitchen sink option, but that would not give you much storage space. hope this helps.. cast iron pan use I use one twice a day on the stove and have not noticed any issues. I have been told that cast iron may scratch the glass surface but I have avoided sliding the pan on the surface.. How much room is between the two 81/4\" burners? Can I fit two 10\" pans on those burners at the same time? I would contact Ge to make sure that you get the best answer.. ',\n",
       " 'It doesn\\'t specify how many inches wide are the burners do you know? There are five burners in sizes: 8\",8\",10\", 9\" and 6.5\". This cooktop is superb. You will never want to cook with gas again. Cook faster, lower bills, doesn\\'t heat house, quick to clean, more work space too. Win win win win.. Cleaning this product -- besides the Cerabrite -- can a glass cleaner be used to removed grease stains Windex, BarKeepers Friend, or Ceramabrite all work great. Ceramabrite seems to last longer than the others. Probably the wax coating it leaves behind.. Has anyone used a cast iron griddle on the two side burners with success? I am trying to decide between this &amp; kitchenaid that has the bridge feature. I haven\\'t tried that but why don\\'t you call GE customer service and ask? Another Amazon customer had the same question. BTW I extensively reviewed quality price and cost before buying this unit for my new home and GE came out way on top in all categories on this unit. Amazon price was terrific, at the time I purchased it late 2013.. Can I have a utensil drawer underneath this cooktop? It says minimum 12\" clearance and that is a lot, most other induction cooktops are 4-5\" clearance Well, we have a stove under it and the stove is not 12\" down.... I want to know the imput V, 110 or 220V? 220V. what is the warranty and how does it work? does ge cover what is sold on amazon? 1 year full warranty and it is nationwide.. Does the unit appear to cycle on and off at lower settings? It\\'s very quiet so it\\'s hard to tell. I\\'ve been using it for a couple years now and absolutely love it!. Is my current 34 1/2\" x 20 1/4\" cut out too large to fit this unit? The manual to this unit says the opening should be 37 1/8 width and 19 1/8 depth of cutout. They also say to use a 36\" base cabinete. I checked with my husband who measured and said that you would be very close. You have to put silicone around the unit from underneath and you may have a bit of an opening. The silicone may show from above a bit. He thinks that if you carefully position it, you should be able to go ahead and have the unit with the dimensions you\\'ve provided. I bought my unit online and there was a service number to call. I would go to retailmenot.com and find the least expensive price then I would call them and have them go over the dimensions so that you are absolutely certain. I can\\'t stress enough what a wonderful cooktop this is. You will love it. I hope it works out for you. If you\\'d like I would be happy to either fax or mail you the installation page that gives all the diagrams and info. My email address is sedolgoff@aol.com. Can you use revere ware on induction cook tops? If a magnet can stick to the pan then it will work. If not then you need different pans. I love this cooktop btw.. Can this work in Malaysia Electrical requirements are 3 conductor 208/240 VAC, 60 Hertz, 50 amp copper wiring. I believe Malaysia uses 50 Hertz.. ',\n",

Does this come with hanging basket inside? Yes it came with two that slide across the top. :). How long is the power cord and which end of the unit does it originate from? (I\\'m trying to figure out if it will reach my nearest outlet. Thanks.) Power cord is about 6 ft from the right side. Be careful of the supplier. Some are including GE in their ads but ship the Chinese brand. Also the handling is sometimes rough in shipping and the bottom of the packing is insufficient. If it is dropped on the power side the resulting dent will void your warrantee if you accept it. View the reports on the suppliers.. What are the dimensions of the hanging baskets? Thanks! sorry. this was a gift for someone else so I don\\'t recall. I recall one fit on either side of the freezer and there was a slightly larger opening in the middle.. How wide is the large section of the interior floor ( not counting the step up part, that hides the compressor.) Do not know. Mine crapped out after only a year and a half. You can decide if you want to gamble on the cost of the freezer and the lost food. Good luck.. Does it auto start after power outage Yep. What is the outlet requirement? Just a regular 3 prong pkug.

I received a 2 fl. oz bottle with my Frigidaire ceramic and stainless steel cooktop (also purchased through Amazon). I see that they sell the Cerama Bryte on Amazon also. Its easy application to ss surfaces. I use it on my Breville toaster oven too. It works very nicely since its a creamy liquid that I apply to a small piece of paper toweling wipe it on your surface and just wipe it off with a dry paper towel. That way there is no over-spray. It shines. I hope this helps.. ',\n",
       " 'Does this unit need to plug into an outlet? No, This particular piece mounts to the top of the exhaust hood. It only redirects the filtered air back out through the louvers in the picture. The exhaust hood does need and an outlet though.. What are the dimensions of this unit? The description says 1 x 1 x 1 inches, clearly that can\\'t be right. 2 1/4 h. X 29 1/2 w x 12\" d. how would yoy change the filter? it looks like you can!t get to it ? This product does not have a filter, as it is the recirculating fan system. Your filter is in the main hood system which can be replaced in about 20 seconds.. does this unit have filters that need to be changed? Yes, but depending on the frequency of use they can last quite a long time.. Does this unit have a light? No,this is just an adapter for installations without an outside duct. The main hood unit does have a light.. ',\n",
       " 'why does ice taste funny Mine tasted a little funny the first few water fills, but was fine after that. I use bottled water in mine. You could try running a batch of vinegar water through it, just make sure you run a couple batches to rinse it well.. Is it a good product, a good machine. If I buy this and it dies in shot amount of time, my husband would have a fit. I bought one to use in my camper. When I received it, I plugged it in and it worked well and as well on our first camping trip, but a month later on another camping trip the ice machine began to make less and less ice. I called emerson and they would not honor the warranty because I had not bought it at Target. So personally I would not purchase another Emerson machine.. What is a cycle? Is it one tray or until full? 1 tray.. What is the \"PTC\" listed on the drawing? Compressor tries and fails to start.! start cap? Is it replaceable by knowlegeable individual? Do you sell It probably is a start cap if it\\'s not a bad connection, somewhere,, if it\\'s a bad cap, might cost ya bout 20 dollars,, if that doesnt fix it, trash it, there to mechanically involved, something else will go out,,, I recommend a small office/dorm size freezer,, has no mechanical parts except the pump, and just make your cubes manually,, good luck. 3 sizes of ice. How long to does it take for each? Small is about 7 minutes. Medium about 11 and large about 15 minutes. Will take a bit longer if water is warm. Suggest chilled water to speed up process.. do i use tap water in the machine? Yes, I have. I let the water run until I know its cold enough. Its been 2 yrs. since I have had mine. Knock on wood, mine is doing good, no problems or issues with it. It has paid for itself, since I don\\'t have a ice maker on my apt. refrigerator. Forget ice cube trays, they don\\'t make enough, take too long to freeze. I make around 3-4 gallon size freezer bags full of ice. This can take all day and into the evening to get nice full bags of ice. You can leave the ice maker if you have to leave to do something. I have, and when I get back its waiting for me to empty the ice and/or add water. Doesn\\'t overheat either, as it shuts down automatically.. Is it comparable to nugget ice (chewable ice) machine that you see in hospitals? No ... it makes regular ice cubes in 3 sizes. My ice maker is making really loud high pitched noise when going through its cycles We went through three of the Emerson Ice Makers in about 1 year. After a big hassle we were able to replace machine #2 under warranty. Ice maker (the replacement) #3 started making noise after a few weeks. Wife found an Igloo brand portable ice maker. The Igloo is cheaper and much better. I haven\\'t had any problems with it in over a year. Hope my experience helps.. Does not reset?? The one I had worked about 3 times then stopped resetting. I finally decided I had wasted $125.00 and tossed it. I try not to buy Emerson products anymore.. Lights flash and won\\'t reset?? Emerson ice maker are junk we have had four and have returned each one after only a few months of use. Won\\'t every buy Emerson products again. ',\n",
       " '1/2 vs 3/4 horse power I\\'m not sure what your question is here. If you\\'re asking whether you should go with 1/2 or 3/4 HP, I think the answer is \"it depends\". If you\\'re in the habit of routinely loading up the disposer with all sorts of waste and expecting it to handle it, the 3/4 HP or even 1 HP model is a better choice. On the other hand, you really should never load up a disposer like this and should not discard larger solids through the disposer anyway. The disposer itself may be able to handle large amounts of solid waste, but your drain pipes won\\'t like it and you\\'re very likely to have flow problems and/or blockages over time if you use your disposer this way.. Can I install it myself? In order to install the Waste King L-2600 you will have to possess basic plumbing skills. For my Kitchen sink all of the necessary parts were supplied to connect to the dish washer and the drain pipe from the sink. I supplied plumbers putty for installation to the bottom of the sink. I am accustom to doing most of my own repairs. Dave.. Does this unit come with the disposal elbow and the dishwasher connector or do I have to buy those as extras? The elbow comes w/ it and where the dishwasher hose attaches is a spout that the hose supplied w/ the dishwasher attaches to and clamps. You just have to remember to knock the plug out the garbage disposal that seals the spout off if your not plumbing it that way.. any plastic parts, i.e. case body.=? The hopper is plastic which makes it very light to install. Disposals have a tendency to corrode and leak after yrs. of use, I hope this lessens that problem.. what about the dishwasher connection? No problem,matched up perfectly with existing fittings.. what type of power cord Unit comes with own power cord to plug in to under sink power source. My new 1/2 HP unit has an electrical smell after use, unit is getting pretty warm but no circuit breaker trip as yet. Replace? I would suspect there may be an issue with the unit you received, I have had no unusual odors from the one I got. It does get a little warm when used a lot, but no smells.. Is Waste King made in the USA Waste King is made by the Anaheim Manufacturing Company. They proudly advertise \"made in the USA\".. It works in a network 220 V? If isn\\'t present, what model works in a network 220V? The voltage is 110 AC on this model. Their line of commercial disposers would be 220 AC voltage. They also make a line of international disposers, if you are looking for a 22 DC model. They are sold under the names of Waste King and Sinkmaster. The Waste King models all start with the letters WKI. WKI-1001, WKI-2600, WKI-3300, WKI-8000, WKI-2600TC, WKI-5000TC, and WKI-8000TC. The TC models require no wall switch for installation. I don\\'t see that Amazon sells any of these models.. What does continuous feed mean? Basically means that you dont have to drop one carrot at a time down, you can just keep pushing it down into the disposal. Thats just an example, but you can also just keep funneling whatever it is down the disposal without the need to take breaks of feeding it.. ',\n",
       " 'what is battery life of the lr44? Not sure how long the battery lasts. I\\'ve had my Mini Hygrometer since last winter 2012. It still works just fine. It\\'s perfect for fitting in small places. I keep it in my guitar case in the dry winter months to keep check on humidity. In humid summer months I keep it on night stand where it doesn\\'t take up much space. I don\\'t expect this digital unit being a small size will go through batteries very fast. Battery could last a year or two. Most important, this unit is very well made. Hope this helps, Stan. Can this be used in a room you want to be used as a root cellar? I don\\'t see why not. I use it in my guitar case. It is one of the smaller Thermometers, but one of the very best in quality built. I have had mine for a year or so now. Never had any problems with it.

(0.552 if you don\\'t count the magnet on the back or the push buttons that extend forward from the front.). is this electric or battery powered? it is battery powered and has a watch-type battery already installed. There\\'s a red tape you pull out of the battery area after you open the box which allows the battery to make contact and it comes on. So no battery to buy. Seems to work pretty good, I use it in my basement to measure humidity.. What kind of batteries does it use? I don\\'t remember the brand of my battery, (Possibly NL) but it is 1 small LR44 (0. o/o Hg Cell) and has lasted me for over a year.. How fast does it change? I have found that as the weather and temperature change - mine is fairly rapid to change - but then I do not have a second one in my case to compare it with to see if one is more rapid than the other, nor do I watch it on an hourly basis.. Is this unit self contained i.e., no external sensor wires? It is self contained but, , , approximately 6 degrees off.. How is this mounted? I want to use it on my motorcycle and mount it to the inside of the fairing. Can I use velcroe or two-sided tape? Comes included but, , , is like 6 degrees off and no way too adjust it.. ',\n",

This one has plastic inside that is pushed aside by a plug, but when the plug is out it covers the two hot slots so it should prevent a child from getting shocked.. My first time buying outlets, if I get these will I need to know anything about the ones I\\'m replacing or are these sort-of universal? As far as I\\'m aware you need to know if you want a 15 or 20amp outlet. My understanding is 15 amp is more common. Check that the unit is not close to a sink or any other water source as then you would need a different type of outlet. Otherwise I followed instructions from a YouTube video and found it very straight forward.. How do these work? I have a new house full of them and I cannot plug in a 3 pronged plug into any of them. when inserting a plug, make sure that both prongs go in at the same time. there is a plastic gate of sorts just inside the openings that need to be opened at the same time. this protects against insertion of items such as a paper clip or a butter knife into one side of the outlet.. can the two sockets be wired separately? i am building a temperature control box and need to independently power two sockets All the Duplex Recptacles I\\'ve ever seen, If you break off the \"Breakable\" metal tab between the connector screws, you can wire each outlet separately.. Is this a 10 pack or single outlet? Single outlet.. Can I replace a two prong outlet with this one? Yes watch what color you take wires off usually white screw goes to white wire and bronze screw goes with black wire. ',\n",
       " 'How flexible is the duct? Is it possible to push it radially? The duct is very flexible, but also very thin. I don\\'t think it will take much abuse in the \\'push it radially\\' department. But it will bend easily. I attached mine to a 90 degree elbow out the back of my dryer so it wouldn\\'t crimp, bend, and close up. But if you are trying to attach it and move it laterally from the outlet (say left to right) I would say you\\'ll be okay - as long as it\\'s not too far, too quick. In other words, this is thin material we\\'re talking about, not the heavier actual metal ducts you have have seen elsewhere. I worried about ti being so thin when I installed it, but it has held up just fine.. Thin/flexible duct causes fires, death? Use semi-rigid instead?

Can you cut it easily to your need? I need about a foot. Yes, with sturdy shears, like kitchen shears or the plastic package,opening clippers. how do you clean the duct? I think a flexible duct is easier to replace than it would be to clean it. Does it fit on a 4 inch dryer vent? I purchased a similar looking product at Lowes and it just does not fit over the vent in the dryer. Yes, mine is a 4 inch vent and it fits perfectly. Isn\\'t this flammable?

       " \"so any way to remove this mold? just replace the rubber gasket/lining? apparently not easy to re-insert... Well the problem with any mold is that it's alive, more or less. So, once it starts, one either kills it or does not. What I did (no longer have that machine,) was always wipe the inside of the seal with a solution of pure liquid bleach, applied on a rag, using my finger tip (rubber gloves, OK) as the applicator. That more or less did the job... depending on how bad it was. But there's no doubt it's a troublesome problem. The other thing I frequently did was run a load of HOT water in the empty machine, with about a quart of pure bleach.

The only thing I have found is when I clean it, the highest cleaning level is too much. I have to use the medium level of cleaning. Other than that this is the perfect oven. When I get a new stove, I will buy electrolux. I hope this helped you. Any other questions, please ask.. problems with fans? No problems with anything yet. Oven is about a year old.. Can the oven racks be removed and adjusted for baking large items Yes, all racks and supports are removable. In fact, the user\\'s manual states that the racks and supports are supposed to be removed prior to using the self-cleaning cycle. The racks just lift right off the supports. I removed mine and repositioned them a couple of times to get them where I wanted them.. May I know what is Org.? Are you referring to something on the oven? Perhaps it means original?? I could not find this term Org. on the Amazon info or my oven. Sorry. any problems with this oven so far?? Yes. Every time we\\'ve run the self-clean cycle it burned out the thermostat and the oven stops working. Both techs told us this was not an uncommon problem - just don\\'t use the self-clean cycle.

       " 'How many bottles of wine can it hold? It hold 6 on the bottom rack - this picture is incorrect. The top 2 racks are glass shelves most likely used for bottles & canned beverages, but I suppose you could also have wine bottle on their side there. Google the model number and you will see the correct picture on the Electrolux website.. How much height do you have for the top two shelves? Can you fit beer or gatorade bottles in both spaces, or does the lower shelf have less space? I am using mine as a pure beverage center (sodas, waters, juices, beers), as I have a separate dual zone cooler just for wine only. As such, I removed the bottom wine rack. I was able to position the top rack so that beers up to long neck bottles (e.g., Coronas) fit just fine with about an additional 3/4\" height clearance, then the middle rack positioned below with enough space for the small (10 oz.) size of canned sodas, then plenty of height on the bottom floor of the unit to again easily load tall neck beer bottles. Note that the bottom floor section of the fridge stays approximately 7 degrees warmer than the upper two shelves, so I use the bottom shelf mostly for bottled waters and overflow beers from the top shelf (drink from the top shelf, quick restock from the bottom shelf to the top). Hope this helps.. will this hold champagne bottles? Yes, we often put prosecco or champagne bottles on the bottom rack and the middle you can lay down whatever you want. Are the shelf heights adjustable for this unit? Thanks! No, the height is not adjustable.. Is the wine rack removable? Could it be removed and then more cans/bottles be stored in its place? I think so. Not 100% positive. The way mine is installed the door does not open all the way So there is not enough room to get the rack out but it does look like it will slide out with the door fully opened.. Could this be used to hold only cans of soda or is the wine rack a permanent feature? The wine rack can be easily removed. There are also 2 adjustable, slide out glass shelves - so a number of configurations are possible.. Can I either choose or change which side the door opens from? Hi, you can change the side the door opens from, but it requires ordering an additional part from the company. Kind of a pesky issue considering the cost of the fridge. Other than this the fridge is wonderful.. My heigh clearance is 35.5\". Are there leg pegs on the bottom of the fridge I can remove? Or is this fridge really 34\" height as specified? It has some screw like legs that help you gain height if you extend them.. Does the refrigerator lock? No, it does not. Can you pull the shelves out to customize space in the unit for say a gallon of milk? Both shelves pull out but they\\'re not tall enough for a gallon of milk. But the pull out function is great for locating bottles/cans.. ',\n",

The display comes with sticky velcro pads so you can stick it anywhere on the fridge (most likely on top or on the side). I used a glue gun to affix the sensor and cord so that they would stay put (the suction cup does not stay on). You may need to adjust the location of the sensor in order to get the reading you desire as it can vary depending on how close it is to cold blowing air, the door jam and also the height.

They also come in difference lengths.. when I was turning off the water by turning clock wise water started to drip out is that normal? thanks in advance If there is no drip when the water is on, but it started dripping when you were turning off the water, you need to replace the faucet. Feel for wetness with your fingers to find out where the water is coming from- if it is above where the hose connects, which in this case it most likely is, the faucet needs to be replaced, or at least new gaskets installed- I\\'d replace the faucet if that is the case. If that is dry, but is wet only at or below where you\\'ve attached the hose to the faucet, then the hose connector is where the leak is occurring. In this case, you probably will only need to replace a 25 cent rubber washer. Dry everything with paper towel or rag before checking where the leak I coming from. Plumbers tape is not an option- your seal is the rubber washer between the hose and the faucet, always check to make sure the rubber washers are in place. Hope this helps.... the connectors 3/8 \" or 3/4\" heading says 3/8 and description says 3/4. opening of faucet mouth is 3/4+brass=3/8, these what i need? Standard washing machines have 3/4\" supply line fittings on both ends of the hoses. These hoses are for a standard installation and have the 3/4\" fittings.. I\\'m ordering one of those little washer/spinner things. If it\\'s close to the water supply, is this flexible enough to fit in the small space? Oh yes.

       " \"I need freezer to just keep ice bags in that? Why would you just use it for ice bags?. What is the right temperature setting for an upright frost free freezer (Frigidaire) To maintain the proper temperature setting in your freezer you need a freezer thermometer. They are cheap and available in almost any kitchenware department. You can then choose whatever freezer setting that keeps the already frozen food at 0 degrees. If you are freezing any quantity of food you should bring your freezer temp to at least -10 degrees. Once your food is completely frozen you can reduce your setting to maintain the 0 degree temperature. Check your thermometer and set your freezer temperature setting accordingly. The fuller your freezer, the better it will hold the temperature and run more economically.. can the freezer door be reversed to open the opposite direction? Off the top of my head I would say no. It has a lock installed on the left side of the door which could not be moved. It also has the digital temperature control and warning signal installed in the door just above the handle on the left side. Due to both of these issues I would say it must open on the left side. I also just looked through the manual and there are no instructions for making it a right opening freezer. I wonder if you might be able to special order it that way?. can this freezer be used in a commercial kitchen? I live in Columbus Ohio It is labeled as commercial, I don't believe it is reliable enough that I would trust it in a commercial setting. I had two compressors go so far.

It takes a couple cycles for the large size to freeze to its max size, especially here in Florida unless I have the air conditioner very cold inside which I dont like.. It says it produces a \"batch\" of ice in 15 minutes. How many cubes is that (medium size)? I get 9 Large cubes in 15 mins. or less. Hope this helps. Awesome ice maker.. ',\n",

       " 'Are the shelves spaced wide enough apart that cake layers could be cooked on the rack? Yes. Does this come in its own box? I\\'d like to give it as a gift and want it to look new (rather than presenting it in an Amazon box). Yes, I\\'ve purchased two sets, each at separate times and they came in nice retail boxes, which I kept for storing the racks in.. Will this hold half sheet commercial pans? The best answer anyone can give you is to check the measurements of the rack against the measurements of your pans. I don\\'t use mine that way, but IIRC the half sheets are too big, I think it will only hold the quarter sheets, but don\\'t take my word for it. Measure, measure, measure. Seriously. There is one bad review here written by someone who didn\\'t measure and blamed the product when their pans didn\\'t fit. Also note that the rack has to be oriented in one direction, front-to-back -- there are posts on the sides to keep things from sliding out. So, if your pan is too long to fit in your oven that way, and I\\'m betting it is, it\\'s not going to work with this rack.. Is the height of the racks adjustable? No.. will it sit on the floor of the oven or does it need a rack? No, it will be too close to the element. I always put my oven rack at the lowest position & then put the 3-in-1 rack on top of the oven rack.. Does this rack come with the individual cookie sheets for each layer? Are they attached? They do not come with the cookie sheets. Only 1 rack is attached to the sides which unfold. The other 2 hook on to the sides.. can you remove any of the racks? No, they are all attached to each other. They do however, come limetedly apart from each other enough to swing the layers to fold flat for storage.. Will a 15 1/4 by 10 1/4 inch cookie sheet fit on all three levels, since I have to buy new ones to use this? Since the levels measure 15.5 x 14.2, if the sheet fits on one, it should fit on all three, as shown in the image provided. But do note the support uprights at the sides. You can only slide sheets or pans in from the front.. What is the bigest size you carry ? There is only on size.. what size is the spacing between the racks? 2 3/4 \" between the racks. ',\n",

How to clean the oven I have since moved to a new city and left the Bertazzoni behind, so I cannot recall exactly how it is cleaned...but my memory is telling me that it\\'s non-self-cleaning, so you\\'ve got to do it the old fashioned way. I\\'d recommend looking up the particular range you have in mind on the Bertazzoni site (just Google \"Bertazzoni manual\" and you should be able to find a PDF and figure it out. :-). How do you set oven temperture ? Which stove do you have?. Does it hold professional sized cookie sheets? Yes. Black burner crates are made of what material? Are they black enamel? Hi. They look to be cast iron, not enamel. As my review indicates, we have had some trouble with this, particularly with technical support. The burners don\\'t always light and stay lit.

       " 'will this vent fit an electric 3.4 Cubit ft. whirlpool dryer? This will fit any dryer that has a (standard) 4\" diameter vent pipe.. Can this be used with a gas dryer. Thank You Yes. Absolutely.. Do you just cut this in half with tin snips and slide part of it back over itself and then tape it? No cutting. It is already in two pieces. It slides up and down and slide it apart for what ever length you need. My husband is a contractor and said it does not need taped if you don\\'t want to tape it. Fits tight. Hope this answered your question.. Is this 18\" from the center of each opening to the other? Or 18\" from the very end of the \"box\" to the other end of the \"box\"? I need to reach 17\" from the exact center of each opening. If you look at the layout of the pipe, it should be 18-20\" Center to Center and 24\" overall. This is per site: partselect.com and type in the model number. The grid is 1\" squares.. The photo doesn\\'t show the other side -- can I slide one of the vent holes to fit a 12\" space between holes? Yes. You just have to trim the excess with tin snips. Seal the whole thing with aluminum tape before placing the two sides. It says 0-18\" because you can slide the two closer together but it doesn\\'t mention the trimming involved. Mine works great!. Is the max length of 18\" measured from center of duct output to center of duct input or elsewhere? Yes, I do believe that it is center to center. I would double check, but it is installed and a little bit of a pain to take out and replace.. what is the minimum dimension it can be shrunk to? I need it to span between 5-9 inches. 0-18. You should be fine. Will this fit on a Kenmore gas dryer? I\\'m sure it will. Mine is a Whirlpool, but I believe the holes are all standard size.. I have about 41/2\" clearance. How much of this will the unit take up? It will work - but not much extra space - depends how much of the connector pipe - the round opening you need to make a good connection with your vent in the wall - 3.5 inches total is a minimum - and 4 makes it a little easier to use. There are not many more options - it is worth a try. Will this periscope be long enough for Whirlpool washer model no.WTW4800XQ 27\" measuring from the center vent? Thank you. I am using this on a Maytag with a center vent. I had to trim the unit down to fit the needed 18 inches of space to cover. Once you trim the unit, I recommend using aluminum tape to seal the edges and side seams. Since I have installed this device, I have had no issues with my dryer taking too long to dry clothes..

       " 'will it work on glass cooktop ? I want to know from the manufacturer not just some one who thinks so I recently purchased a new, ceramic glass cooktop range. In the literature that came with the stove this Griddle was advertised. The model number corresponds with the Whirlpool model shown here (4396096RB). The description specifically advertises that it works on ceramic glass cooktops: \"Commercial-grade, cast-aluminum surface safe for use on gas and electric ceramic glass cooktops and ranges to expand cooking surface.\" This is straight from the manufacturer. Hope that helps! (I plan on ordering one). Would 4396096rbc griddle be compatible with my flat top electric stove #D41717691? Yes I have an electric range it works great. Does this sit on top of the existing \"grill\" of my gas range or do you take the existing grill off and set it in its place? Does this have legs? We have a gas fired cooktop. We place the griddle on the grates right over the burners. There are no legs. My wife\\'s comment is \"I love that thing\". It is somewhat heavy so you have to consider where you will store it.. I have a glass top but not with the extended burners. Since it\\'s so long, will it work using 2 separated burners together? yes I typically set the smaller burner a little hotter The griddle is thick and heavy so it takes some time to heat up - be careful and dont set the temp too high if you get impatient - once its TOO hot then it takes a long ti8me to cool to Just set the temp that it should be and give it about 4-6 min to heat up. Can I use it inside an oven? I would not think so. Why would you want to? It\\'s a stovetop griddle.. will it work as a replacement for Maytag Model CDE852 Jenn Air electric range? Approximate open size of hole is 18 /2 X 10\" This is a big rectangle piece of metal that can sit on any flat surface. You can put on a barbeque grill or lay it on the coals. Your electric range top will have no problem with the grill unless your top is too small.. Will this work on an older gas range? That would depend upon the dimensions of your burner grates, but having had a couple of gas ranges in then past I don\\'t know why not. I can\\'t say for sure, however.. will this fit on the 5 burner whirlpool gas range Not sure which one you have but I use it on my KitchenAid KFGS366VSS 36\" 5 burner. It fits perfectly over the two right-most burners and works great. Only catch for me is I have a KA \"snorkel\" downdraft vent at the back of the cooktop and I have to make sure the griddle is clear of it before turning on the vent fan.. Where is made? Wisconsin. Works great. I love it.. what is the diamentions of it? Roughly 19 1/2 by 10 3/4 fits perfectly over the two burner. ',\n",

I have had this for a few months now. No problems and the (well) water always tastes good.. can you couple two hoses together to make one? need a longer length One would need a male coupler as the houses have female ends.. Does it have a .25 Inch Fitting? yes. what is the size of this product? I searched the Whirlpool site for this product but it doesn\\'t specify.

I\\'ve got it attached to a 2001 Maytag. what is the diameter?? Generally the same all-over as your typical US garden hose and USA-standard GHT (\"Garden Hose Thread\") metal fittings at the end, which have a 1\"1&#8260;16 outer diameter on the threads. The \"L\" turn is the smallest diameter point because it comes from the inside diameter of the hose.. Will this hose work for a steam dryer? Yes. I have a steam dryer and these hoses are great!. Are these hose made in the USA I checked the entire package and it does not say exactly where it was manufactured, but for the 5 year warranty replacement you send them back to Bremen Indiana. They are of very good quality.. can this be used for refrigerator ice maker The supply lines for a washer are the same size and fittings as one\\'s garden hose. Also, a washer requires two lines: one for hot and another for cold water. A refrigerator ice maker requires a single 1/4\" copper or plastic line. Also, the fitting at the refrigerator requires a different type of connection. Go to Lowes or Home Depot and buy a specific kit for an ice makert. While there you can compare it to washer supply lines and the difference will be obvious.. does it automatically stop leak? No, they are just regular hoses, just better quality.. ',\n",

       " 'What size ice does it make? I\\'m looking for one that makes small (like Sonic) ice. Maybe slightly bigger. There are two sizes it makes. The largest one is probably no more than 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in length. Each cube has a opening at one end and is hollow. The cubes are more like hardened slush than regular ice cubes and do not last very long in a room temperature or even chilled liquid. The other end is rounded as are the sides except for the opening side which is flat. The holding basket for cubes made is directly over the water level compartment so the cubes are very watery and start to melt if not removed immediately. The basket in the water holding compartment directly under the door lid on top of the unit is not cooled except by the cubes that are made and put into the basket by the device. Taking the cubes out of the device and putting them in our freezer as they are made is a small task, but once in the freezer each individual cube freezes solid and to each other also due to their watery condition so you have to use a tool or pick to separate them from each other and any others that were already in the ice cube container in the freezer. I did not find any other brand that was very much better except very large devices used mostly by dinning places. This device works, but don\\'t expect regular frozen cubes nor the ease of storing them very long as a normal freezer would store them.. Do I need to shut off ice machine to empty ice basket? Instructions do not say No you don\\'t. If it produces ice while out, the ice will just go down in the water.. What is the size of the ice-maker? Its about 14\" tall x 24\" deep x 12 \" wide. It doesn\\'t take up a lot of counter space but its amazing how quickly it makes ice and how much it makes. I highly recommend this item. If mine dies, I\\'m getting another one!. Not enough characters for me to ask question - I\\'ve cleaned with hot soapy water and used disinfectant - which does work, but could I use vinegar... I\\'m guessing that it has a \"funny\" taste when you fired it up the first time? If so, it\\'s because you didn\\'t let it sit for 24 hours after you took it out of the box. During transit, if it\\'s turned upside down or on it\\'s side, the gear oils run everywhere. Letting it sit for twenty-four hours before starting keeps it from tasting awful. Otherwise, I use vinegar to clean mine out once a month. And I only use filtered water to make ice.. Is a scooper included? Yes.. is this really 12 volt I will not recommend this ice maker. Extremely loud and broke after 7 months. Not working If out of warranty I would chunk it, else return for repair or replacement. These are great machines when they work. Clean water in, clean ice out. Would recommend buying extended warranty on these type ice makers. Our Koldfront was purchased as a spare for our SP brand which looks the same. However after going thru 4 SP brand units, each with a different failure in about 8 months, they issued a full refund. Today our 2nd Koldfront has failed after less than 6 months of use. Does not fill tray therefore makes very small ice. Will update later.. How do you get it fixed? You don\\'t ! Throw it in the trash and give this piece of crap company a bad rating. I have had 4 units go bad on me and they wouldn\\'t do crap for me. When you buy a real unit make sure it does not look similar to this one . if it does its made by the same company. Good luck and happy holidays. Did anyone have mold problems inside the machine? No. We have used this product for the last eight months every day and had no problems with mold.. This items states free shipping, but when I go to check out it is adding a shipping cost of $5.58. Is this a free shipping item? Good Afternoon, This item does have free shipping.

Why is water pooling under deli drawer in refrigerator? there are two things. both are easy fixes and one fix is easier than the other. first, open your fridge drawers and see if they kindve come back. if they dont at all, then your problem is that the unit is too level. just get a pair of pliers or a wrench the correct size and twist the front feet of the unit higher than the back. if the doors swing back, then the unit can drain properly. if that isnt the case, then you have to clean two tubes found behind the unit. if you take off the large plate on the back of the unit, you'll find two white rubber tubes. make sure the fridge is unplugged for this. take those tubes and any assembly pieces out and wash them with hot soapy water. rinse them well. allow them to dry and reinsert them. those things clog every couple of years if there is a lot of sediment in your water. we have had to do both. we've had our fridge three and a half years and still love it. little maintenance, but overall nice. there is no drain cup to dump, and other than replacing the water filter every six months, it is pretty maintenance free. just make sure the front is higher than the back and clean your tubes every couple of years--esp if you have hard water in your area..

It's still going strong with minimal noise. I would recommend it. I don't know what others are saying about the disposal, but as a picky kinda cranky virgo perfectionist I have no complaints about it.. the unit is jammed, resetting it does't help, how do you remove the object jamming it. Disconnect the power source. Remove the sink insert and shine a flash light inside the unit. You should be able to sight the item that is jamming up your unit. Pu your hand inside if it is small enough and the power is disconnected and remove the item. If your hand will not fit you will have to improvised with a tool that will work to remove the item. I hope that this will assist you.. Does this model allow for a connection to your dishwasher? Yes. Does it come with a cover, so this side of sink can be used as a washer? If not can I purchase the cover? Hmmm....I think the cover is something that would come with your sink, not your disposal. I'm sure you could find a universal one at a hardware store.. Where can I get a replacement sink plug for the Titan Food Waste Disposer? Try this website: http://www.mrscrappy.com/Products-Replacement_Parts.html. Does anyone know WHERE can I find replacement cutters for a Titan T-1060 food waste disposer? Only from the company I think. I've been looking for the magnetic ring. Mine was broken when the company sent it to me and they would not send me a new one.. Is it compatible to Badger 500 Yes. I had the Badger 500 for years until it finally gave out. The Titan fits in the same ring and has more power. the Titan is a great buy.. where can I buy parts/ I don't think you can. Another reason not to buy cheap Chinese brands.. where to buy parts I never had to buy parts. It may be cheaper to buy new one.. \",\n",

Will this fit a kitchenaid side by side refrigerator? It fits mine but I do not know my model.. will this fit the Whirlpool Refrigerator Model Number GC5SHEXNS03 According to \"FiltersFast\" (.com), I think the answer is No. Whirlpool Refrigerator Model GC5SHEXNS03 replacement part Whirlpool PUR 4396710 Filter Replaces Kenmore 9030 (4396710) Your model GC5SHEXNS03 uses the 4396710 Whirlpool PUR 4396710 Filter Replaces Kenmore 9030 The Whirlpool PUR 4396710 Filter Replaces Kenmore 9030 is the new and improved replacement water filter for Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerators with easy access through the front base grille push button access. SEARSPARTSDIRECT says your refrigerator is a \"side-by-side\" and also says \"No\". From the picture they provide it looks like your filter has two attachment points (\"nipples\"?) where the PUR you\\'re asking about only has one. Can you get a replacement number off your existing filter (turn the water supply to the fridge OFF before removing the filter) or use it to compare to pictures to find online?. This won\\'t work if my old \"fastfill\" filter has 2 connectors, right? Just want to be sure since can\\'\\'t return it. thx I am not sure about your old one and the toe connectors. This one only has one end with a little gasket on it. It would not fit something that has two connectors. Sorry, I know that\\'s not really helpful. Could you look up your fridge\\'s model online to verify?. Will this PUR filter fit my top/bottom Kenmore Elite that takes Kenmore filter model # 9915 from Sears? Edward: On the side of the box it says brands include, Whirlpool, Maytag, Kitchenaid, Amana, and Jenn-Air. I\\'m using it on a Kenmore Coldspot. I had been buying the Brita quarter turn filter at Sears so if you\\'re fridge takes the quarter turn filter it should work.. Is this filter made in USA? Yea this filter is made in the USA.. 4396508 Are you asking if it fits this number? Not sure. I just know to look for a \"quarter turn\" filter of any brand.. ',\n",
       " 'Which one is this? There are two models: Part 4396710 should not be used with refridgerators with \"Fast Fill\" or \"PUR Measure\" dispensers. If your fridge has these features you should purchase filter 4396841. And the only difference is that if you use the wrong filter, water might flow out slower than what you are used to. Not a big deal! The ONLY difference between those two filters is what model is appropriate for your fridge, otherwise the actual filtration quality between the two is the same.. t1rfkb1 This Whirlpool water filter is the best water filter available for Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerators with push button base grill access. The Whirlpool 4396710 is also known as the Kenmore PUR water filter and does not remove fluoride from your water. The 4396710 water filter is used as a replacement for cartridge T1RFWB2 in model T1WB2/TIWB2L. The Whirlpool T1RFKB1 is the same filter as Kenmore 469030. These filters are ALL the same as this filter PUR W10186667 Push-Button Refrigerator Water Filter! I have a friend who is a Sears technician so don\\'t worry Heather it is the same!. Is this Part 4396710 or 4396841 I don\\'t see that number anywhere on the filter. But it fits my Kitchen Aid fridge. However, on the box of the filter, it says that it is compatible with 4396710 and 4396841.. are fridge water filters universal? I have a kenmore fridge - and the filter is on the bottom left of the fridge look like what it is shown in the pic I also have a Kenmore fridge and it fits perfectly. Amazon has an amazing return process, so I suggest getting the filter and returning it off its not the right one. Thanks for asking!. DOes this filter work the same as the Kenmore Ultimate II? It works great. Not sure about Kenmore II but we have a Kenmore Elite Side by Side and have been very pleased!. what are the dimensions if you purchase the w10186667 push button filter as I do,the length is 12\" the diameter tappers from top to bottom.Best measurement.....top about 2.75 at the widest point.Bottom about 2.0\" hope this helps.. will this filter fit a kenmore That\\'s the refrigerator I have..

       " \"The picture illustrates this part as 240v but I need to make sure it's 120v. Can you please tell me if this part is 120v? There is no way of just looking at this and being able to tell the differance, you need to verify the PN# and machine effectivity by serial # to know if this is the correct part.. Will this work on a gas dryer? Or just electric? Part says 240 V.. my gas dryer is 110. Worked on my gas dryer. I also bought a new ignitor (279311 @ $13.55) and fuse (3392519 @ $2.90) and replaced all three parts at once since I had the machine apart and did not know the cause of my no-heat problem. After replacing all three parts, dryer works.. purpose of thermo fuse Hi. This is the component that regulates your dryer's temperature. If the temperature gets too high (possible restricted vent, too much lint, etc.) the thermo fuse burns open thus stopping electrical current and the dryer.. Is this a Genuine OEM Whirlpool part? Mine (from Supply Edge) was not Whirlpool branded on part or bag like the rest of my Whirlpool repair parts. No it's not but it worked just as good as the genuine part. my model number is 110.76915110 original pt no. is 342763 will this part sub or do you have another part that works? it should. is this the same part as for the kenmore oasis themostat Yes. can this be used on inglis led4400vq1 dryer This is a Whirlpool/Sears product. I would suggest that if your dryer does not product heat and the coils are broken or damaged; you should google your model number looking for a parts listing. When you see the element they should provide a drawing of the various parts in this assembly. From what I have seen these are much a standard part. You might want to try this trick, if this is the only part you need to replace. This is some type of fuse to keep your dryer from overheating. Take it out and if you can test the leads, if you can. If not the top should be flat and yours may now be more domned. If this is the case throw in on a concrete floor three or four times. This causes the dome to flatten and if you did measure the ohms should see a change from negative to positive. Bottom line no need to replace this part, if this is all that is wrong.. It seems that i need a thermostat and thermal limiter for kenmore compac dryer. The Sears part numbers are 3398128 and 343607. Same as yours? I don't know, but you can usually cross reference to an FSP part number. They make most if the piece parts anyway.. Can this thermostat be the cause of the timer not advancing ? Yes, if you are using an auto-dry cycle, such as Whirlpool's Miser-dry cycle as in the auto dry cycle when this thermostat cycles off, the power is redirected to the timer motor to advance the timer to the off position. There is no power to the timer motor until the thermostat cycles the heat off and then that power is directed to the timer motor. If your timer will not advance in timed and auto dry probably you have a bad timer or wire. If your timer will not advance in AUTO dry but will advance in timed dryer...problem is normally not your timer and in that case most likely this thermostat needs to be replaced, see: http://www.theapplianceclinic.com/autodry.html. \",\n",
       " \"How many dead bodies can I store in this thing? Well I suppose it would depend on how you processed them. I would say 2 average size corpses whole, folded in half of course. If you quartered them you could probably up that to 4 as it would be easier to arrange. If you ground them up, like with a wood chipper or perhaps a Vita-mix, you could probably do 7 depending on how you packaged it. Which brings up an interesting point this product has 2 baskets and 1fixed devider but it could use more division. I am going to do something with possibly plywood to give me more seperation for meats, vegetables, meals ready to cook, etc.... is this energy star rated? Just like the other customer stated, I do not see a star rating either. But I have had mines since July 11, 2013; and I have not noticed an increase in my monthly electric bill. I followed the directions for setting the temperature; before adding any food; and have not touched the setting since. I have been really pleased with my freezer. I have mines in my car garage/basement, and the temperature in the summer, which was not very humid, did not appear to affect the freezer. The directions stated the basement is not recommended if your basement gets very humid. It runs quietly. The size is just right for me and my daughter to store quite a bit of items when I find a good sale on vegetables, meats, pizzas, microwave foods, etc. The small basket was great during the summer to store freeze pops for my daughter and her friend.. What are the interior dimensions of the freezer? 25 inches deep (top to bottom), 34 inches wide (side to side), 15 inches (front to back) there is a built in shelf starting 9 inches from the bottom on one side leaving 9 X 15 inches unusable. wheels Yes, there are two wheels on it making it easy to slightly lift and move. What is the energy use? I believe that it may be just 150watts.... how much does it weigh It's just over 100 pounds. I couldn't lift it by myself into our basement.. why is my Danby 700 making so much noise? You should probably call customer service to see where to get it repaired. Because mine runs super quiet.. How hot does it get on the outside? I'm keeping it inside the house not in the garage, so it is a concern I keep mine in the garage, but I've never noticed it getting warm or hot to the touch on the outside, admittedly. It always feels somewhat cool to the touch, even on hot days (I live south of the OBX, so every day is a hot, humid day).. can you plug it into a regular outlet Yes. The plug isn't a special kind. Mine is plugged in a regular outlet in my garage.. I live in the northeast and was wondering if anyone has this in their garage or breezeway? Don't know if it can take the temperature swings we have. I live in northern Ohio, it goes below freezing regular in the winter. That is supposed to damage the compressor because the oil is cold and stiff and starts hard. I went on ebay and got a Temp controlled outlet for 15 bucks and a little (the smallest they had) stick-on oil pan heater. I sanded the paint off a little spot on the compressor and put it on. It comes on at 35 degrees F and goes off at 45. If you are going to have a freezer out in the cold I think you have to do this to keep from ruining the compressor. So far it's working OK, this freezer goes down to almost 0 F, so it's running at 15 degrees.. \",\n",

Will this item work for my Kenmore dryer model #11066652501? i just googled and it said yes.it is very easy to install. Will this work with a Kenmore model# 11068322700 ? Hello James, if the dryer is yours you could pretty much operate without an element (it will be cold only), but the question is \"Are you getting a strong air flow?\" I\\'m not going to tell you what to do before you buy it, but I\\'m going to tell what I did: I took the element out, I found the broken element, I twisted with a pliers and put it back the the broken element with twisted fix worked again for another another year. Now, elements usually break for the lack of cooling or air flow, so if you put a new element but nobody at home is removing the old lint, the new element is going to burn again. Use your hand and arm and make sure there is no blockage whatsoever inside the duct. Regarding model, before I purchased I went to several sites and found that they are very similar. I thank God, that the guy selling the element in this site, is not running a nuclear power plant, because it would have been smarter to take a picture of the element, than to take a picture of the box, right? At any rate, Amazon is very friendly with returns if it doesn\\'t work you may have 30 days to return. I hope it helped, good luck!.

My suggestion is to turn off the power and remove the old element and take it to your local appliance store and they should be able to find you a good match.

How much current does the igniter draw? (I depend on solar power) I couldnt honestly tell you not sure in the slightest sorry. what does this part do.my gas oven wont heat up on bake.will this part fix the problem? On ovens that use electric ignitors (instead of a pilot light), these ignitor heat up and glow bright yellow and ignite the gas. They are almost so bright you can't look at them. Look for yours underneath the oven where the gas is, turn it on and if yours is orange or dim it needs to be replaced. When the ignitor is on, the gas flows based on the amount of electrical resistance, if yours is failing, the current isn't strong enough so the gas doesn't open fully. This can cause no ignition or extremely slow preheat.. Will the fit in my range Model fgf326wgsg I'm not sure it fits my Frigidaire Model FGF366ECA perfectly.

Will this work in a Frigidaire ES340 gas range Very likely. Many appliance brands are actually made by a few manufacturers, and they use common components to save cost.....the same gas valves, burners, igniters, etc. Best is to look up the actual part number and check compatibility. Second best is to remove your oven floor pan and visually match it to the product photographs. Be sure to unplug the range first.....120 volts is present at all times in a number of designs. Good luck..... will this work for NXR range? Don't know--not an appliance expert. Often many different brands use the same parts.

The wire is covered in heat-resistant and seems just fine. I may pack some heat resistant ceramic wool in the ignitor back wall opening where the wires go back in the oven but I have not yet. That probably is an overkill. The only difference is that I did NOT use the ceramic wire nuts provided.

       " \"will this work for model 10651512100 and does this kit provider conection directly to home water line Yes, this will work on your model . Connecting to home water Line is a different set of parts. I've installed this valve but it didn't fix my problem. Included is plastic tubing and fitting, but no instructions on how to install. First of all...what is the problem? Are the valves not turning on and off, or is the water just not flowing to the icemaker. My problem was both. Since the water dispenser was working, I 'tested' the old icemaker valve by disconnecting the water dispenser valve's electrical clip and attached it to the icemaker connection. Then pushing the water dispenser lever on the front of the refrigerator I got no water flow and knew the icemaker valve was faulty. Once I replaced the valves and reconnected the water lines, still no water was going to the icemaker. I disconnected the ice water line and tried to blow air through it. Blow hard as there may be water still in the line. I couldn't get air to pass through. Turned out the water line also was frozen on top of the freezer. I unscrewed and removed the icemaker cover to get access to the black water dispensing tube. Usuing a stiff wire and hair drier for about 15 minutes I was finally able to melt the ice in the water supply tube. Problem also could be the electronic control board. If you need to check if that is the problem, set icemaker to ON and pour about a cup of water into the ice cube tray. You should have a set of ice cubes form and ejected within an hour.

The answer is \"NO,\" failure of this thermister will not cause the fridge to not start or the relay not to click. All this is is a sensor that tells the contro board when the cooling element is all frosted up and needs to be defrosted so that the control board sends a signal to the switch that turns the defroster element to start the defrost cycle. If your fridge does not start and the relay does not click it would likely be the main control board. It is very common for these boards to go out on these fridges. Hope that was helpful.. ',\n",

Go to a gas appliance place and buy the kit and they will tell you how to convert. A RV dealer might be a good place to do this.. Is it CSA approved? Hi Kim, it's ETL approved, not CSA. Thx.. i don't have enough space for a exhaust hood or over the range exhaust microwave, any suggestions of product to provide exhaust ? is it required? not really required for this stove. Can it to be installed above an under-counter fridge? Yes it can.. Hello, Does this cooktop have a propane conversion kit? Thank you! No. Just simple stove.. can you use this for outdoor too? I wouldn't allow it to get wet. U have your electronic ignition that would get messed up. No exposure to the weather.. \",\n",
       " \"How well does the downdraft perform? Do I still need a hood as well? Meagan, The downdraft on the GE rangetop has handled anything we needed it to. We do not have a hood and don't intend to get one. Pat. are the knobs on this model stainless steel to match the trim, or plastic like the all black model? Thank you They are stainless to match the outer trim/border. Perhaps plastic underneath, but very heavy feel and excellent look.. Do you need any additional items for the installation of the downdraft? Contractor could not use old parts. Had to get new parts for installation. Parts were not expensive. Approximately 100.00. Can this be installed over a dishwasher? no - the downdraft extraction fan won't install over a dishwasher. Where does the downdraft go? Mine would be at one end of the counter with a built-in oven on the other side, family room behind and kitchen in front It should go outside the house.. How loud is the downdraft? Very loud.. I'm putting in new granite countertops as well as the downdraft cooktop . . . does it matter which I do first? Well you would want your granite to be cut to fit whatever downdraft stove you get. If you get the range first they will just cut the granite to fit your range.. Will this cooktop fit and work where there was a JennAire 2 burner/grill with the downdraft? I replaced a 1983 era Jenn Aire with this one. I had to cut a little bit more of my shelf space inside my cabinet for the blower and duct work to make it fit just because everything didn't align up EXACTLY the same but it was damn close.. What size cut-out for this? 26 1/3. can this top be insalled over an oven? No as the down draft will restrict the use of this cooktop over an oven.. \",\n",
       " \"What are the reviews of LG LDF7774ST The worst dishwasher made on the planet. Replaced it twice in 26 months then was told by L.G. that it wasn't made to last forever..... Why does the bottom rack goes off track often Mine does the same thing.. leaking and ruining floor...not supply fittings ...what could it be ? It could be that there's a crack in the tub itself. If you're seeing it leak from the front, that could be the fan that is in the door. Ours had to be replaced after 3 months of buying it. If it's still under warranty, call the store and have it checked out. I hope this was somewhat helpful.. The spaces on both the lower and upper racks are so far apart that my dishes fall down unless it is so full that I can wedge them against each other. Does anyone have the same problem and/or a solution? That's not actually a problem. The face of the dishes need to angle down slightly for the spray to hit them to free any stuck food.. \",\n",
       " 'will this fit my jenn air s-160 range? I do not think so. Go to Jenn-air\\'s site and check to see if it will work.. Does this fit Jenn Air Model S136? Call Jen Air, they were very helpful. Is this the same size as the A122? Martha says, \"Yes\". As we studied the one we bought recently vs. the original we think that is the correct answer. Martha is happy to have 4 heaters instead of 2 and a grill.. why it does not stay on high continually I suspect what you are seeing and asking about is that if you turn the burners on high and just watch them, they glow red quickly but then seem to turn off and on instead of staying bright red and this is different than you are used to on the old-fashioned type of burner. Stoves are automatic systems that turn the electric current on and off as needed to keep the burner at a desired temperature. They don\\'t adjust the amount of electricity applied to the burner...they turn on the power full-blast or completely off. A sensor monitors the temperature and turns the power on if it is too low or turns it off if it is too high. The radiant cook top is a special kind of element that can get VERY hot VERY fast (much faster than the old kind). The temperature sensor is near the element below the glass and the element gets hotter than the hottest setting quickly and turns of the power even though the pot of food above the glass is still not super hot. So you will see the burner get red then go off several times before your food finishes cooking. This is normal. Even though it seems like it would get hot faster if it just stayed on continuously, that would actually be bad because the element would overheat and burn out. Old style burners do the same thing, but you don\\'t notice it as much because they take longer to cool down and stop glowing red so it seems like they are always on when you set them to high (but they aren\\'t). The same thing that makes them stay red longer, also makes them take longer to get hot so if the new element was made to be a lot slower to heat up, it would seem to stay red and it would work like the old kind (but it would take longer to cook your food).. Do you know if this will work for a GE...looks the same?? I\\'m not certain of the model #?? Look carefully at the pin placement- how it plugs in to your stove and the wattage of the unit. Also the size of the opening for the replacement- seems to me the sizing was not correctly listed by the manufacturer.. What size are the burners and what is the largest pot I can put on this stove top? 6\" AND 8\" BURNERS. 13\" pot. I saw a response saying this has white spots on it. The original does not. Is it correct that it has white dots on the glass? negative, mine does not.. Will the replace my A 100 cartridge? Yes. The cartridge in the picture appears to have white specs therefore it would be a white, which would indicate it is model JEA8120ADW. Can you verify? In the black cartridge the specks on silver. The specks in the white cartridge are black.. Will this work on my range with mfg id E25378? Yes. ',\n",
       " 'I\\'m looking for this type of hose without the the flood control feature. Does this hose have one? If not I\\'ll order it. thanks This is simply a steel braided hose that replaces the rubber hoses often found on washers. The fact that it is stronger and less apt to burst, it can avoid a flood in your home.. Hi, can you please tell me if the measurements are accurate as listed? I want to order this item asap with the measurements listed. thx Item is 96 inches long (8 feet), so it is accurate as listed.. how many cables come in package? The package contains one hose.. are all washing machine connection standard? To my experience yes.. Can all washers use 3/4\" hoses or do some require 1/2\" As far as I know all North American washing machines use a standard 3/4\" Garden hose fitting.. When it says \"1/2 inch i.d.\", is this the inner diameter of the stainless steel hose itself? I want small diameter hose for flexible movement. Thanks! Yes Benda \"i.d.\" refers to inside diameter. The hoses are flexible. Most people use them for connecting the water spigots behind a washer so they won\\'t burst and flood your laundry room. They are quite flexible. I don\\'t think they would fail if flexed a lot every day, but they are metal and would probably eventually have problems. If you\\'re talking about being able to use them with the same flexibility as a rubber washer supply hose they are pretty close.. I need this for an extreme flexible hose need (OUTDOORS). Does anyone have a clue if this type of material will hold up well outdoors? Werid I know. Given that it\\'s stainless steel it should not rust outdoors. It\\'s made of braided metal material. If this won\\'t hold up I\\'m not sure what would. It may be remotely possible that if you keep water pressure on and the temperature drops well below freezing you might have a bulge, I just don\\'t know. I can\\'t think it would breach under about any circumstances. I use these for my washer connection because I don\\'t want to have to turn on and turn off my water supply to my washing machine. Hasn\\'t failed me yet.. Are these lead free? They say lead free on each hose. Is this considered a \"fill hose\"? Yes, these hoses are used to fill the washing machine with hot or cold water. They are sometimes referred to as \"Fill Hoses\".. ',\n",

       " 'Does the door open in the front? Hi Carol, Yes the door opens from the Left side to the Right side in the front. There is no visible handle like on an average refrigerator, it is a hidden handle at the top on the left side. It is indented so you can pull it out. Also, with no handle sticking out...then no one can walk into the handle or get their clothes caught on it. The Danby has a nice top that is strong and can be used as a shelf if needed. It cleans easily too! The Danby DUF408WE is a wonderful freezer and it is Totally Silent when running! When you open the door it has a suction effect and the motor makes a low hum. After you close the door, you can feel and see the door suction inward as it makes it air tight. The Danby is really the best freezer I have ever owned. The Danby is one of the best decisions I ever made! (Hmmm...of course the Best decision I ever made was when I met my wife and we both knew we were Soul Mates for life!) If you choose this model freezer you will not be disappointed. Hope this review helps you? Best regards ~ Marc. Is this freezer frost free or must it be defrosted? It\\'s a great freezer, we have ours now for nearly 3 years. But yes, it has to be defrosted from time to time. I used it to store breast milk and later homemade baby food. Thus it was opened/closed multiple times throughout the day. Each time new air and moisture enters they will be frozen.. This freezer would be put in a carpeted bedroom. Am I going to have soaked carpet when defrosting? not if you put something down to soak up the water. Is the inside large enough to fit a 20lb turkey with or without a shelf removed? Probably not lying flat - certainly not in a tray. It could probably fit if you stood it up vertically with shelves removed.. Can this be used in a garage. Is it ok in the winter? It would be against the inside wall of the house in the garage? Hi Mr. Butterfield, My wife and I have our Danby Freezer in a small room in our apartment in NYC. The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is constructed so well that there seems to be no reason why it would not do perfectly well in a garage. If I had a garage, I would put the Danby Freezer in it too. Also, the Freezer is Silent when it is on! It makes a very low noise after you open the door and close it, that it sounds like it is making it airtight. The Danby Freezer has heavy duty plastic sliders that move smoothly when pushing the Freezer on a floor, they also adjust in height if a floor is a little off balanced. I feel the sliders on the Danby Freezer would not move easily on a dry cement floor, unless it was painted to a durable and smooth finish. Therefore, I would protect the floor that you put the freezer on from dry cement, corrosion and dampness. I would set the Danby Freezer on top of a 1/4\" inch thick Plexiglass plastic flooring or something similar. The Danby Freezer is easy to clean and defrosts rather quickly. You can place a small one inch tall long baking pan set on the floor with the door open and any water draining out can be caught in the pan. There are no ice chunks forming inside the Freezer either. It just has a frosty coating or snowy look around the walls and elements inside the Freezer that melt off the interior when it is defrosting. The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is the Best Freezer I ever had! You will not be disappointed. Best regards and Happy Holidays for the New Year! ~ Marc. Ship charges to 60060 ?

For the collar, I used a THREE inch coupler, designed to couple two pieces of three inch (interior diameter) sprinkler line together, fitting over the outside of the two pieces of sprinkler line. However, you should seriously consider whether how long a hose line will work in your application. Best wishes!. Is the vinyl translucent at all? I need something that doesn\\'t allow any light in.

I would imagine that it can be trimmed but I would take it to a sheet metal shop where they would have the proper tools to trim it to size without putting any bends or creases in it. This piece comes with finished edges and you would have to keep in mind that if you trim it in any way, that you are cutting off one or more of the finished edges. Personally; I don\\'t think I would try to trim it myself for fear of damaging or destroying the piece. I hope this is of some help to you.

My appliances are brushed stainless steel. Is the back splash shinny or brushed? It is brushed.

Just checked it with my cooking timer.. Can it be installed over ceramic tile? Yes, it could be installed over tile by using plenty of thin double sided tape or by caulking (or putting adhesive on the back). The sheet is reasonably thin, so as long as you don\\'t try to secure it at only the 4 corners it should look ok.. what type of stainless steel is this??? I think it\\'s a stainless steel. It\\'s been great for me. It\\'s thin and could be cut easily if needed. It looks great as the back splash behind my stove.. Is this magnetic?

There are 2 sets of holes for each of the 4 tabs to attach to the bag to prevent sliding back into the trash. They are very durable and also prevent odors.. Do these bags have the 4 holes to fasten to the compactor. Thank you. They do not. I found, however, that they were deep enough that I could fold them around the outside of the compactor and they did not slip. This was particularly helpful since I have broken two of the buttons which held the bags on my compactor.. Are these the same size bags as W10165296RP - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001... I believe so. Check the size bag your compacter uses against the size of the 18\" whirlpool bags. They fit my compacter but are a bit big which is fine.. Do whirlpool bags fit viking compactor Hi--I don\\'t know. I have a Kitchenaid compactor. Check your inside measurement of your compactor and you will be able to see if the bag is big enough to go inside.. ',\n",

The screw slot is about 11 inch from the back of the unit. Standard depth of cabinet is 12 inch so yours isn\\'t too far away. You can also drill extra holes to secure the unit.. how many sones is the noise level? 2.3 on low and 4.3 on high - these are specs off the company website. I love these units - I have bought and installed four of them. Does the Kaze 202 come in Black? We are sorry that the K202 does not come in Black. So far only stainless steel is in stock.. We need a low profile hood to mount above an island. Is this unit wall mount (we hope not)? Is the backside finished so that it can be left exposed? The unit is not wall mounted, and the backside I think is finished.. what is the actual thick of this hood 3.5\" and 4\" to the back that contacts the wall. It flares down like a triangle. If you need a pic of it mounted, I can email you some shots.. Can this unit convert to ductless operation? No. what is actual width of this unit? I believe it is 30 \". It is a superior range hood. My friends purchased a range hood locally and paid twice as much for it. They felt cheated when they saw my dual fan range hood with light.. What is the measurement for the mounting screws and also the duct opening? We need an online version of the installation manual to know the details.. I do not know. I needed this unit to be a rear exhaust but it wasnt. it is only top exhaust. so I returned the unit. It was very nice but did not fit my application.. The smoke is discharge from the top or from the back. It vents at the top.. ',\n",

Will this work for a kitchen aid KEBS278ABL-0 I have no idea, since I was only concerned if it would work with my GE oven.. Is this compatible with GE Oven JK955SOF3SS? I am not familiar with that oven, so I have no idea. However, it would probably work with any oven with a temp probe socket. I use mine in an Astivita brand oven, and it works perfectly. I am about 99% sure it will work with your GE Oven JK955SOF3SS, providing it has the correct size socket for the probe.. Will this work on a Convection oven model# JVM192002?

I\\'ve replace several over the years.. My previous filter is Whirlpool 4396395. Will this work? Yes, either model will work just fine.. What triggers the \"Replace Filter\" indicator light, a meter or a timer? If it\\'s a timer, isn\\'t it likely that filters are often changed prematurely? On our Maytag, there is a \"Replace Filter\" light that changes from Green to red. The packaging says says change every 6 months, but ours usually lasts a year on average before it turns red. I believe it is calculated on the number of gallons that passes through the filter. We are a house hold of 2 people and 2 dogs. It has average a year of usage consistently for 7 years. Now if you had a house hold of 4-5 people, it may last a shorter period. But I do believe it is based on the number of gallons that passes through the filter that triggers the change filter indicator.. IS THIS THE SAME AS UKF8001AXX-200 This came in a two pack and I still had the box for the second. On the side it says it is a replacement model for UKF8001AXX-200.

Will this fit a Whirlpool # GD5RVAXVB00 looked up your model same part. I have a KSRB22FKSS04 Whirlpool side by side MFG date 08/03. Is this the right kit for that fridge and does it include both sensors? This kit contained both sensor and was a very easy install. Is this the control board for a Kitchenaid KSCK25FVMS00? Thanks! That's the infrared board for an in door icemaker, not a main control board.. will it fit Kitchen Aid side by side model KSRL25FRSS03 Thanks do not know about the kitchenaid, however as you will see in many posts, it quits working or works erratically. spend more for the actual replacement parts.

       " \"Does it come with the middle wash arm and tube and all the clips and parts? Mine came ready to install and it was easy to do. Lower rack required some work and broke one part while assembling it. No replacement parts are sold - only complete units. Bah!. Is the rack adjustable to lower one side for tall glassware? No. Mine is not adjustable.. How do you lower the side to accommodate tall glasses? Which tab is moveable? I couldn't figure that out, was rather disappointed that the rack wasn't tiered like my previous rack (with the left side for shorter glasses and the right for taller glasses). It also messed up spacing for taller plates below, I have to keep those to the right side and stop about the middle or the top rack will clank into the plates. I have to put wine glasses on the bottom racks now.. \",\n",
       " 'Excuse my ignorance but is the 49\" back to front or side by side? I only have a 36 inch wide space 27.7 Depth x 29.9 Width x 46.9 inches Height. These are the measurements for the range it is considered a 30\" range.. how does the self cleaning preform self cleaning works like a dream. excellent. Is the power cord included ? Thanks. yes. I just bought the glass top stove....black.....no matter what I use to clean it it always looks smeared....any suggestions ?? After cleaning with the regular glass stove cleaner, I spray mine with Windex mixed with white vinegar then polish it with a clean cloth. Works pretty good.. what is the width of this stove You will need a space at least 30\" wide and this will be a little tight so try and go at least 33\" wide so you have a little bit of room to work with putting it in.. is this a convection oven? It is just a regular oven. I\\'m not sure what a convection oven is.. Do the top burners heat evenly throughout the coils or heat from the center coils outward as the temperate is raised? It looks like it heats all the coils and then blinks off. The hotter the dial is set, the longer the burner is hot before it blinks off and the shorter the burner is off before it glows red again.. Will cast ironcookware scratch or mar the elements? It will not scratch th element. If iron cookware and its content is too heavy the element support will sag or break and will touch the oven liner.. does it come in black? Yes. Does this model have the Hot Surface Indicator Light and the Heating Element ON Indicator Light? Yep, it sure does!. ',\n",
       " \"Does this work for Fruit leathers? nope, i am pretty sure the liquid would drip through the holes in the mesh.. Are the holes small enough to keep corn from falling through? Yes they are. What did you use to cut the netting into sheets? I have the round trays and since it is black, I cannot mark it with a Sharpie and cut with scissors. I also used round trays. I bought a sheet of green poster paper, used a magic marker on the paper to trace out the size and shape I needed, and used scissors to cut out a template. I then used some duct tape to tape the template to an old piece of plywood. I could then lay the netting on the template and cut it with an utility knife, since I could easily see where to cut by the color of the template.. what is it made of can you wash it Yes you can it is a type of plastic. do you think the netting holes are small enough to keep wheat berries from falling through? All I have is wheat screens to try with. The large wheat berries did not fall through.. Why is the weight of the product listed at 1 lb. and shipping weight is 4 lbs.? Product plus packing and container shipped in. What material is the netting made of? It's a type of food grade anti stick plastic. Do not be alarmed about it being plastic. I have used mine over and over I wash it in mild detergent and it still performs and looks as the day I bought it. Really is a must have for dehydrating some items. I totally recommend this product. What is the width and length of the roll? I have already cut mine so the length I am no sure of. The width is 15 inches. I got 6 out of it for my 10 drawers.i will get another roll soon. My garlic is almost ready for drying. The fruit leather sheet roll was great as well for the dog treats.. is this one sheet or a roll; if it a roll, how what is the length It is a roll. Not sure the length ,but I can cut it to fit 3 of my stainless steel wire racks with some left over. It does curl a lot, so I use stainless wire to attach it to the racks. Works great! I am pleased with the product.. What is the length &amp; width of this roll? I don't have the exact measurements because I have cut it up. However I believe I purchased two rolls its the perfect fit width wise and there was left over after cutting one for each (10) tray. I love it. It is easy to clean a must have for smaller cuttings and berries.. \",\n",
       " \"are they 2 in a pack are they flat black color yes there are 2 in a pack and they are a matte finish. not shiny black. Are the extenders flat or shiny black finish? What about the one comment that they melted to the stove and were hard to remove for cleaning? If you look at the comments from 2011 & 2012, you will see if there are problems with this product. On the other hand, if you look at the comments made in the past year or so, the product is perfect, suddenly. You have to wonder if these are true reviews or those manufactured by the manufacturer. Possibly, they changed the material of the product itself and improved it. I found another product that works well and has given me no problems. http://www.rangekleen.com/index.php?cPath=13_315. does it melt after a while? If your oven temperature exceeds 375 degrees for more than 30 minutes the possibility of melting increases. I've done it and it is now partially stuck to my stove. Not sure why it isn't designed to withstand what could be considered an average oven temperature. Plastic will only withstand so much heat so it may be wise to see if there are non plastic ones availabie. So, yes, it will melt.. I need a shorter length. What is the best method for cutting the plastic to avoid cracking and an unsightly edge? A jigsaw? Use hack saw do use jig saw will damage.. do you have this in color chrome and perhaps 22' or 21' in Length? We do not have chrome strips!. Are there two, one for each side or is this the price for just one and therefore you have to order two? Mine came as a two pack.. I am looking for a similar item in clear color, but can't locate one on amazon. Could someone point me in the right direction? I have not seen this item in clear. how long is it? 23 inches. You get a pair.. Do I get a pair for the price of 19.99 There are 2 in the package, yes. Still a little pricey, but overall effective.... Is this available in white? It is available in white from another seller as of 9-24-14. http://www.amazon.com/Stovetop-Extender-SE23WHI-Oven-Guard/dp/B00290VZ2G/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1411579026&sr=1-1&keywords=stove+crack+cover. \",\n",

It isn\\'t soft like silicone...it is firm but slid in just perfectly on each side. wipes clean easily also.. What color is it Black. Does this have a magnetic strip to attach to the stove? Yes, about half an inch wide where it contacts the side of the stove.. Is the black semi-gloss in color or dull? thanks! It\\'s a flat black-no shine really.. I have a tiny gap. Any chance they won\\'t fit the tiny gaps? I don\\'t see the exact thickness in the product description. It\\'s so thin I can\\'t even guess at the measurement. I had to \"wiggle\" my stove to get it to fit but got it in there!!. does this come in white and how long are they This comes in black only. I do not recommend this product as it is not designed to keep crumbs from falling between the stove and the counter. It is designed in an L shape rather than a more productive T shape.. Can either of these be cut to fit i need it around the back also since the stove is in a counter island. I don\\'t think it would cut very well. It has a magnetic strip on the inside that is glued on so you would have to cut through that. The other material is a very hard plastic that might splinter. what is better on a oven glass top or burners Since it fits between the stove and counter top it shouldn\\'t make any difference. It\\'s just wide enough to fill in the crack between the two. Hope that helps.. What color are these guards? black. Can these oven gap guards be cut to fit if they are too long? Yes, I just used good shears and cut it down a few inches to fit. Worked fine. ',\n",

       " 'is this an aftermarket or original . I can\\'t tell. But for what it is worth it was an exact match and has been working since.. How do you install the Whirlpool Dishwasher fill value W10158389? I am not sure what exactly you need to know, but I presume you understand that you need to turn the dishwasher off from electric panel, then shut the water coming to the it off as well. I also presume you know how to get to the part by removing the access panel and some insulation. The part should be on the left side. When you remove the old valve out you need to understand that taking the screws out is not enough to remove it. You need to \"unhook\" (if I can say it) from the frame it is mounted on. Try t wiggle it up and down gently and to the sides and you will be able to detach it from the frame. This way you will be able to bring the valve closer to yourself and you will be able to see and access the electric plug and incoming water hose and out coming water hose. So, unplug the plug that supplies the voltage to the old valve by squeezing the \"locks\" on the plug. The plug unplugs similarly to the telephone line from the phone outlet or network cable. Keep in mind that the plug might be stuck. So, you may want to move it to the sides gently. If it does not come out it may mean that you are not squeezing it right (find that release latch). Then you need to take off the incoming water supply hose and outcoming water hose. One of them can be twisted off using adjustable wrench while the other (thinner one) has a wire based spindle (I hope I call it right), which secures the hose on the valve. Some remaining water will come out. So, it is a good idea to have a towel in that area to capture that water before disconnecting the hoses. Then you do everything in reverse using the new valve. Make sure that the thin hose fits all the way on the new valve and is secured with the wire spindle again. This may require some effort to do it. Also when you put the thick hose back be gentle and do not over tighten the nut of the hose.. is this part, w10158389 water inlet valve for sure in stock? As of 2pm eastern, yes.. does this valve work on model du910pfgq1 Don\\'t know, but you could call the dishwasher parts supplier that provides this valve and they could tell you. This is what I did just to double-check that it would fit my KitchenAid Dishwasher. Good Luck.. Is this a brand new unused part (Whirlpool Dishwasher Fill Valve W10158389)? The part I received was new and fit and worked perfectly.. ',\n",
       " 'does the tubing come with the plastic vents No. What is the diameter of this duct vent and how long is it? I need to extend my portable duct which should be at least 8\\' long and 6\" diameter. Do you have that size. It must be vinyl since it\\'s visible. Thanks, Product Dimensions is 6.1 x 5.9 x 2.8 inches.SJS Commercial.. Will this docking system work through the laundry floor? Have short space from bottom of dryer to wall. Flex hose to crawlspace and alum.pipe out. I don\\'t see why it wouldn\\'t but keep in mind that hot air rises, so you are making the blower work harder to get the air outside.. Is this a standard 4inch diameter vent system. Thanks. Yes, 4 inch dryer vent pipe fits on this quick connect dock. I used it on the dryer of a rental house I own. I don\\'t know yet how durable it is though. The only thing I am concerned about is the heat from the dryer might cause the plastic to become brittle over time and break.. what is the contact between two flanges? Or just two simple piece plastics? It is all plastic.. Should the two pieces in which one is male and one is female to have nice fit? I\\'ve installed two of these and they work great. It is not really a \"male-female\" structure, rather there are inter-locking tabs or hooks on the two flanges. It makes for a nice attachment that locks in to place solidly yet unhooks and comes apart easily as well.. Does it come with the dryer? No - the Dryer Dock is an after market product used to connect the dryer vent to the outside wall - it helps if you need to move the dryer in or out - keeps the vent in place so you don\\'t accidentally end up with hot air pouring into your laundry room. Great purchase.. Are both pieces part of the kit, the two white plastic sleeves shown- one for the wall and one for the hose? Yes. Does it connect w/ aluminum hoses? You can attach w/aluminum hoses but may need drill small holes to attach it to the base. Good Luck. i have the dryer dock but it keeps falling down the lower part why? I\\'m not quite sure what you mean. My dryer dock is secured tight to my wall with screws and the quick connect part twists in to the screwed in side to make a snug connection. Maybe one of your tabs has broken off the screwed in side making for a loose connection?. ',\n",
       " 'If the rack is facing the sink it drains into the sink, how/where does the extra slide out tray drain? it doesn\\'t. The water sits there and you get your arms and chest wet everytime. I didn\\'t like the way this stainer has wide bars. you cant put small items in it without them falling back into the sink or on the floor. the black trays turn white quickly even with frequent cleaning.. Would it rust? Hasn\\'t yet. Sems like good quality stainless steel. Is it black? I thought it looked dark blue, by my daughter who has much younger eyes said it is black. It isn\\'t a dark black, it has a grey mixed in. I like it a lot.. Can the slide out tray be inserted from either side of the main rack? Sara, You can insert and obviously remove the slide out tray from either size easily. You can leave it in place or leave it out entirely. It cannot be moved out from the front or rear because there are support feet at those ends.. Is the silverware tray easily removable to enable putting in the dishwasher to help prevent mold from pooled water? Yes, you may do it easily. It\\'s the best tray I\\'ve found! Easy to clan and to use. Is the color a shiny chrome or brushed steel? the metal parts are shiny chrome (what you can see in the pic.) the rest is a cool gray. hope this helps!. Does the spoon holder have holes in it? Yes it have holes in it. Is the drain tray angled so the water goes into the sink &amp; NOT all over the counters? Yes, slightly. I have an under counter mounted sink so it\\'s sleek looking yet functional. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s angled enough for an above mounted sink with a lip. I hope this helps!. What\\'s the best way to clean the \"white residue\" that builds up on this? Had this for months now and I love it. Just want to clean the \"hard water\" I have not had mine long enough for residue, but would suggest a vinegar solution to clean any residue. It\\'s generally a great cleaner for stuff like that..

Plastic, Metal? Plastic w/magnet. My stove is about 1\" lower than the counter top with about 1/2\" gap between the two. Will this work? Thanks I don\\'t think the would look good.

Do you guys generally leave the door open between loads? Is the seal easy to wipe out? I wash everything in cold so wonder if I\\'ll get mold? We wash with cold only too, and leave the door open a little. The seal is easy to wipe out. I haven\\'t given it the test, of closing the door, as I don\\'t want that moldy smell. We had a different brand before this one, and it got smelly if you closed the door for very long - and we only used cold water there too. We\\'ve had this unit in about 9 or 10 months now, and it is the best unit we\\'ve ever owned. We have a very limited water well, and the 13.8 gallons per load is wonderful - and they are BIG loads too. It is located in an area where everything can be heard, yet it is very quiet. We love it so far!. Does anyone have this installed on a wood floor? Any vibration or \"walking\" issues? If so, how did you fix them? I have these units installed on terrazzo decking on a Navy barge. I restrain the \"pair\" by strapping them to the wall. I did once have a real bad vibrationi issue when my installer neglected to remove the vibration dampening spring restraints at the base of the unit. These are installed by the manufacturer to keep the washer drum \"quiet\" during transportation, but must be removed upon installation.. how low to the floor is the washer? do you have to get down on the floor to unload? The bottom of the door is about a foot from the floor. Yes, you need to bend over or kneel.. How long does the washer cycle take? Don\\'t know the exact minutes but it seems to be about like any washer... not a super long wash time.. Will it fit into a 27 inch wide space?

       " 'You actually crank this. Does it crank easily or is your arm sore afterwards? It is well balanced and cranks easily. You tyrn it at one revolution per second, so it\\'s a slow turn. I am 75 years old. If i can do it, anyone can.. Does it get all of the detergent and softner out when rinsing the clothes? I think of my Wonderwash as a hand crank front loader. The key to the Wonderwash is to not over load it. You need head space so that the cloths can tumble while washing and rinsing. I use liquid detergent and softener together while washing, which consists of 200 rotations forward and back. I then let the cloths drain and I refill the tub for a rinse cycle. After another 200 rotations, I drain the water and put the cloths in my spin dryer, which will remove the soap, softener and dyes. I return the clothing to the Wonderwash for the final rinse of 200 rotations and then back to the spin dryer where the water comes out pretty clear and if it doesn\\'t, then i go for another rinse. Keep in mind you can not do your laundry in bulk and for this reason, I believe, that my cloths come out cleaner, which you will notice with your colored cloths by how much dye will be removed when using the Wonderwash and a spin dryer combination for the first time. Cloths that I\\'ve had for years, when washed in my Wonderwash for the first time, released a lot of dye, which totally shocked me and made me realize that my cloths weren\\'t really clean at all. For me, obtaining a spin dryer was the key to the whole process. You need to see the water being released from the cloths to decide if they need rinsed another time! Hope this helps. :-). How dry are the clothes after washing? One of the challenges I have with sink washing is it takes forever to air dry. Very wet and it is amazing how long it takes clothes to dry that way. That is why I bought a mini-dryer as well so for about $100 total for the washer and dryer, our family cleans delicates and daily wash when we don\\'t have a full load in these units. The kids actually have fun doing the laundry and we leave the majority of clothes for our front-loaders. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HT0958/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1. how many items fit in this product? We usually don\\'t pack more than 6 large mens t-shirts. The clothes need space to move around in order to get clean. Usually one pair of jeans will fit. Sometimes you can put two pairs of women\\'s jeans if they are a thinner material. I\\'ve done some larger loads of light clothes like underwear, undershirts, and tanks. I wash many pairs of socks by themselves (up to 15 pairs at a time).. Would this be able to wash a pair of large men\\'s jeans? I\\'m thinking of getting one of these for \"in-between\" washing. Yes. Comparing this to the Laundry POD, this seems to not dry clothes as well? Can you not spin dry the clothes after a rinse? No. I just let it drain until it stops dripping. Last rinse I usually let it drain for 10-15 min. You still have to wring out clothes. Different clothes, of course, hold more or less water....but the ones on the bottom definitely have more water in them!. can be used for washing shoes? sure can...my sons sport shoes were muddy; i brushed off dry dirt and placed them in the wonder was with hot water i scrubbed them a bit with a brush...a minute and a half to two later shoes were clean....i love it. Do you have to hand crank this yourself?? I see a handle but confused as to whether its electric or self propelled by owner. Please help It is hand crank but very easy. No electric. I love mine. It saves electricity and you can use it if camping or away from electricity. It has an amazing capacity much larger than it looks.. Can you wash towels in it? Yes, you technically can but I don\\'t know that you would want to. While the Wonderwash is great for lighter clothes but for heavy towels, it\\'s a pain to dry. Not so much difficulty with the washing but the drying part is a little bit of a pain. Having said that, even though I used the Wonderwash for lighter clothes only, I still managed to reduce my electric bill by $50 a month so it\\'s really worth it, if you have the time.. On a full load how much water (in gallons) do you need to fill it? Also will this work with powder detergent? (1 tablespoon also?) Its requires 6 quarts / 1.5 gallons on a full load.

So, I\\'d probably say yes as long as you are not placing it directly near or on the burner or on the oven door.. Will these work if my stove is slightly lower than my countertop? It would depend how much lower. They slide between the stove and the counter top so they would probably work just one end of the slider would be lower than the other side.

I am concerned it will break after 6 months. My suspicion is that the reason people have it break so quickly is because they run it with the load unbalanced. It is INCREDIBLY difficult to get the load properly balanced, and if you allow it to run unbalanced it destroys the motor. I\\'ve had mine for four months, and it hasn\\'t broken yet, but we shall see. Personally, I wouldn\\'t buy it again because of the load balancing issue, even if it doesn\\'t break.

Dear John, This model does have several safety features that will automatically shut off the heating elements. For example, it will shut of the heating element when a spillover is detected. If you are trying to wipe up spills near the controls, we recommend you use the clean lock/child lock function which will avoid any changes to the controls while wiping that area. My favorite shutoff feature is the timer which lets you decide exactly how long the heating element should be on and will shut it off when the time expires. This model will also shut off the element with a warning indicator if an improper material is placed on an element, or if a proper pan is not placed within 90 seconds of the element being turned on..

My dryer opens from left to right and the required trim to cover it isn\\'t reversible. Yes. Will this also fit the washer GEW9200LW1 or is there a different part number for that? It doesn\\'t fit to the washer.. Will this fit Duet Model # GW9200L? Thank you, Not sure ... Google it. Will this also fit the washer GGW9300PW4 or is there a different part number for that. In my experience, the door is not reversible.. Is this the correct kit for model WED9610XW Honestly not sure. There is a lot of confusion as to which reversal kit got to which dryer. Mine is a WED94HEAW1 model and although the manual indicated we needed a kit we did not. Look under Google with your model number with door reversal. Odds are you will find a YouTube video explaining it. I hope this helps.. My Duet Model number ggw9250pwo. Is this correct kit? Yes. my duet model number is ggw9250PW3. Is this the correct kit for my dryer? It is the correct kit.. ',\n",
       " 'Does this wringer work best attached to a steel tub? Would 20 /12, 22, or 24 inch width tub be the best size? The wringer is very heavy and it does need to be attached to a tub. I use a metal tub. It would have to be a very heavy duty plastic to be able to support the wringer. I do suggest using a metal tub.. The tub needs about 20 inches of straight side to secure it. I use a large oval tub. a round tub would not work, as it would not have the straight side to secure the wringer to. I put the wet clothes into the tub and wring them, putting them into another basket. The wet clothes gives the weight to secure the tub and as I wring them then the water that is squeezed out and falls back into the tub gives me the weight I need to balance out the weight of the wringer on the tub. Securing it to an empty tub will cause the whole thing will tip over.. This seems like a lot of money for a simple mechanical product. Does the manufacture provide replacement parts, particularly the rollers? I\\'m sorry I don\\'t know if you can get replacement parts but the unit is built so well and I\\'ve used it a lot since I\\'ve owned it and has performed beautifully. I have taken mine apart just to lubricate the rolling points I put silicone paste on the moving parts in glides a lot easier, hope you find this helpful. Can it be attached to a table to use as a fondant roller It can be attached to a table. The wringers are adjustable to accommodate different items; being unfamiliar with working with fondant, I\\'m not sure about that use.. Can anyone let me know the tub you use that attaches to this product successfully? My husband put in two utility sinks. We put the wringer in the middle of them. Clamping them together. But it would slip a lot so my husband put two bolts through the sinks and wringer and it works perfectly. Hope that helps.. do the rollers actualy touch each other? I want to uses something like this to roll thin film from a larger roll and the rollers would have to touch. Yes they touch. You can adjust the tension between them as well.. How many inches wide can the clamps be expanded? In other words, how wide a stand can they attach to? As you face the wringer the wide way, the two clamps are right at 14\" apart and are NOT adjustable. I have the wringer fastened to an old outdoor end table, mounted onto a 2 x 4 on its edge. but the clamps could probably clasp over something as thick as 2 1/4 to 2 1/2\" perhaps. This is the second one of these I\\'ve owned and sure beats wringing by hand which is hard on your wrists as you age (I\\'m 65). I do recommend that once you\\'re done using it, to release the pressure from the rollers.......will keep them from \"flat spotting.\". I would like to attach this to the side of my tub in the bathroom. The tub side width is 4 inches....how could I attach this? Hi, I use this to wring out towels for drying my car. I attached to a 1X4. I do not think it would work on a tub.. Are both rollers driven by the crank? Yes and it\\'s work good also. Is the crank really loud or noisy? Another person stated in their review \"Plus cranking the handle is noisy\". Sometimes. We would occasionally grease ours - it helped.. I am looking to use a ring to get meat out of crab legs.

       " 'How much laundry detergent do you use? For 2-3 gallons, maybe 1 tablespoon and 1 tablespoon white vinegar to break up the smell in my clothes because I sweat so bad.. Do you need to pull the plunger out of the water to fill with air, or do you keep it submerged? You don\\'t pull the plunger all the way out. You fill the bucket so that it just covers the lower part of the plunger and a portion of the top part. When you raise the plunger a few inches, the air goes in through the top portion called \"the breather.\" I find this product very effective and easy to use.. What do you do if it falls apart? Mine did Screw it back in, the whole thing screws together, if it falls apart it has gotten loose so just screw it back together like you did when you first assembled it.. I\\'m assuming you use it with a bucket, how big? I purchased two 5 gallon buckets from Home Depot.. I\\'m assuming you use it with a bucket, how big? Your bucket & how to use it: I use a 5 gallon bucket (you know, the kind sold at home improvement stores with the company\\'s name & logo on them). Given the diameter of the washer, anything smaller shall probably be too narrow. However, if you can handle to weight of the water, you could use a larger vessel. For most batches of laundry, I fill the bucket half way (2 1/2 gallons) along with my detergent, agitate a few times to develop some suds, and then add the dirty laundry. Agitate like mad for as little as 30 seconds (for lightly soiled & delicate items) to 90 seconds (heavy things like jeans). If the item(s) being cleaned are very soiled (ground in gardening dirt on the knees), I find a good minute agitate followed by a soak for a couple hours and finished with another minute agitate will lift the ground in mud.. Would this be effective for a pair of jeans? Doing a dozen of: socks, underwear, shirts. Loads to small to take to the laundrymat Yes. How long is the handle I think they forgot to give me the handle because I didn\\'t get one. I read somewhere that the handle was small. I bought a mop and unscrewed the handle, then just used that. It worked out fine.. How many clothes (say t-shirts) can you comfortably fit into it without stuffing them in? On average how much can you wash at one time? I used a 6 gallon round plastic bucket, and I put in 3 pairs of levis. It seemed just about right. Get a wringer or else your stuff will take forever to dry on a line.. How long do you do this on a load of laundry ? Personally I shoot for about 6 minutes -but- I break it up- I go about 2 min at a time and let it soak several minutes in between. I feel this really is effective. I usually give it 2 rinses- but agitate it for maybe 1 min each time. This really is a great little gadget.. Is this device good for getting out tough stains? Is this better than using my hands? Oh my gosh, YES! You should try to pretreat the tough stain with a bar of laundry soap like Fels Naptha or Zote. Use the washer on the clothing and then let it soak for really bad stains. Then go back to washing.. ',\n",
       " 'All the image shows is the tubing. Does this come with the entire \"KIT\"? Does it have the connections to add to PEX Tubing supply line under sink? No, what you see is what you get. It\\'s the PEX tubing with the attached fittings as shown.. Has anyone used this with a newer GE side by side fridge? I have used it w a Kenmore Elite side by side. It is very likely going to work, new fridge icemaker connections tend to be stadardized. The user\\'s manual may have a section on the ice maker hookup and tell you what type of connection your fridge has.. One of the questions\\' answers indicated this is NOT the kit and does NOT include the fittings for a new fridge. Which fittings do I need to purchase? It works exactly as a copper line. It\\'s like the lead pipe but in PVC which is way more convenient.. will this attach to a standard 1/4 compression fitting or if the nut on one end is cut off will the tubing attach to a 1/4 shark-bite fitting. Both ends have a 1/4 inch compression nut. The receiving fitting must have a wide enough opening to receive the end of the pex tube (look at the blown-up picture). This should fit just fint on the inlet on the fridge. On the other end, depends what you have installed. There are at least 2 types of copper shut off valves, one of these (a fitting for a flanged copper line I believe) will not work. Yes, if you cut off one end, it should fit the shark-bite. Btw _H_D_ also carries this exact line (except GE branded). Is this product suitable for attaching to fridge and tiny cold water tap on wall behind fridge? Apt. plumbed with tiny tap. This attaches using a pressure fitting at each end, not appropriate for a cold water tap. If you get a saddle valve to tap the copper line to the cold water, then you could hook this from the saddle valve to the fridge, or you could look for a diverter valve adapter to attach to the faucet ,and then this to the compression fitting.. I have 3/8\" PEX plumbing in my house. Can I attach this 5\\' tube to 3/8\" PEX. Is there an adapter/ coupler When I attached the ice maker and dish washer I used shut off valves. A kit (in the wall) for the ice maker and just an inline valve for the dish washer. There are valves made to push directly onto the PEX and have the compression fitting for the ice maker line. If you use a kit then use one of the PEX to FPT connectors. Hope this helps.. Does the packaging that comes with this supply hose state that it is lead free? Does it meet CA Prop 65 requirements for lead free? Not sure what the packaging says, but the hose is plastic, so I would assume that it is lead free based on that. Don\\'t have anything concrete to though.. is the tubing 1/4 Yes, it\\'s 1/4\" internal diameter tubing -- standard for most refrigerator water/ice maker lines.. ',\n",
       " 'Can you take it apart and put it back together with both Inlet and Outlet facing the same direction.I\\'m up against a concrete top and bottom. Also, these situations require a lot of ingenuity and customizing. DO NOT USE DUCT TAPE. Buy the special aluminum tape. I was told by two other people that duct tape would fall off due to the heat. I bought the special tape mentioned in one of the reviews. By the time you have crafted a custom vent and installed it in a very tight space (with lots of trial and error, especially getting the vent taped to the outlet and inlet) you will have so much time invested that it is not worth the risk of using duct tape and finding out that everyone else was right!. What gauge metal is it made of? Not sure. Its really thin though. I was capable of bending by hand and cutting with tin snips easily.. my wall opening is a bit higher then the dryeroutlet, as well as about 4\\'\\' to the side.. i can\\'t move the dryer to line up the wall opening/dryer . This thing should work. It is not a plug-n-play solution, however. You will need foil tape, and tin snips to adjust the thing to the right size. Also, you will need to somehow get behind there to put the large hose-clamps in place and tighten them. It took me about 45min to get it set up, but since then it has been great. There is less resistance that my old flexible hose so the clothes dry much faster. I\\'d make sure that the periscope has the right opening dimensions so that it will match with your wall vent and the port on the back of the dryer. The 4\" and a bit to the side should not be an issue. Good luck! BTW, you many want to wear some type of gloves so you don\\'t cut yourself on the metal when you install it. ;). My offset (mid dryer pipe to wall exit pipe) is nine inches. Will this unit work? No, the 0-5\" refers to the center to center. You need longer 0-18\".. Earlier I asked whether this was standard size (for washer). Duh. What I meant was standard dryers. Is hole standard diameter? Yes. When fully extended, are there 5 inches between the inlet and outlet edges or centers? As I recall more like 4 inches. Very difficult to get an accurate measurement. However there is a big improvement in the drying time since installing this product. Does the crimped end fit inside the 4\" pipe that vents to the outside? If so, how do I secure this connection? yes it fits inside. It just seemed to be snug enough not to pop out. It has been ok for over a year.. ',\n",

I just installed one of these filters, water didn\\'t come through when I turned faucet on, tried to remove filter and reinstall and it exploded??

Due to the varied outlets from home to home, the power cord, or pigtail, is not included with any new range.. has anyone had issues with the warming burner not shutting off? Not as of yet.. Is the smooth cooktop suitable for cast iron or heavy pressure canners? The Cooktop is glass therefore scratchable, chipable, and breakable. So can you use cast iron? yes, but it is not recommended and the weight and ruggedness of the cast will easily scratch and chip the top. So you have to be careful. The weight of the pots just make it easier to bang the pot on it. I would not use the cast, but it can be done. I have used an allumnium pressure pot seems to work ok. I would say no to cast iron save those for your gas camp stove.. Also it does take longer to heat for example to boil water than the traditional electric.. How many burners??

There Is a warming burner suitable for melting butter. This is a great stove but hardly a commercial range.. does the left oven door open down or sideways?

I want to make sure they are long enough for reach my washer connection. I don\\'t have my machine any more but I did love it. I connected the hoses to the kitchen faucet when I used the machine so they must have been around three feet in order to reach there, but I can\\'t say with accuracy. I have an oval shaped faucet. Will the adaptor work with that? I have never seen an oval-shaped faucet. Unscrew the little piece at the end of the faucet. If the part with the threads is round, you won\\'t have any problems.. Can you pour water into the machine instead of connecting it to the faucet? you can. The machine will start as soon as enough water is in the tub. A good idea is to pour the water in an hour or so before washing. That way, you can let the clothes soak in soapy water, and they\\'ll be easier to clean.. Is this machine quiet? I\\'m a night owl and tend to do my household chores in the wee hours. I live in an apartment--will this wake the neighbors? I\\'d say it is quiet, I live in a small apartment, I attach the machine to my kitchen sink, when in my bedroom I cannot hear it when washing, it pulsates, when it spins, it gets a little bit more noisy, especially if, it\\'s over loaded.. please explain how this runs by batteries? It doesn\\'t. A lot of people ask this question because of Amazon\\'s stupidity. If you look at the Technical Details section, you\\'d see this: Batteries Included? Yes Batteries Required? Yes Battery Cell Type NiCAD Description Pile AAA Rechargable Average Battery Life 15 hours Battery Capacity 25 milliamp_hours There are also other weird descriptors like \"200 beats per minute.\" These weird erroneous descriptions are all over Amazon. They have nothing to do with this washer. IT has to be plugged in and does not use batteries.. How well does this spin water out of clothes? It does a decent job, but it will not \\'nearly dry\\' things like jeans or hoodies. They won\\'t be dripping wet, but they\\'ll still be very damp. You may want to get that spinner like some others have suggested to push more water out of your heavy garments. Also, if your laundromat is nearby but you just don\\'t want to sit around for hours waiting for your stuff, you could do a few loads in your washer, put the items in a plastic bag, and run down there to dry them (sitting in front of the dryer so no one rips you off) for a half hour or so. I make do with my HAIER and a clothesline very nicely, and am able to set up a clothes rack that can handle the laundry of two people very well during the winter months. For very heavy things, though, if I had a lot of them, I\\'d probably do the \"run to the laundromat and use the dryer\" trick.. Do you have to plug this into a wall hookup or can I set it up in my bedroom/ or bathroom? You need a drain for the water and of course an electrical outlet. We have it draining into the bathroom sink. The kitchen or bathroom would work.. Can you put the drain line into a tub rather than into a sink drain? Is the tight fit important for drainage? Yes, you could put it into the tub to drain. It has a hard plastic \"U\" to hang over the edge of a sink. It doesn\\'t require a tight fit. I put it over the edge of the kitchen sink between the dish drain rack and the edge of the sink. That way, it doesn\\'t slip off when the washer pumps out the water.. what are the batteries for Hi Penny, I too did see that in the manual, However, I contacted Haier directly, They informed me that they have manuals and most of them are in \"template\" format and for them not to \"reinvent the manual\" they tailor and modify the manual specifically to the appliance. They assured me that the Haier HLP21N Pulsator portable washer is 100% electrical with no need for batteries. They also went on to say that this machine does not keep \"memory settings\" like in there other models that do. So, in a nutshell, this was a typo left on the manual and rest assured that your washer does not need batteries for any reason. Happy Washing ! George. ',\n",

I know the washer has a manual override where you hold the knob so it will fill to the top. Do you have to hold the knob to fill on rinse too? Yes. What I do sometimes is I just use the extra rinse feature rather than wait for the rinse and to hold the button down. I think there is an entry on these comments about how to alter the machine so it will fill to the top line on an extra large load. I have not done this to my machine..

Does it share the same template (duct cutout size) as the older model #56? Not sure what the model # was on the one that we replaced, but it was old -- most likely original to the house which was built in 1979. All we had to do was drill a couple new holes to mount it over where the old one had been. Very easy!. Will this controller work with the Aprilaire 600M? I am not 100%, but it seems to me that it will. There is simple (and i mean not very discriptive) instructions with it. This unit 600M may require a transformer in the electrical loop. mine did. I had to get a doorbell transformer from homedepot. If you dont have one, you might as well order one of those too. Just a simple electrical loop and this humidistat is the switch.. Will this humidistat work with a Totaline P110-LBP2417 humidifier?? Not sure re compatability. The humidstat is just a relay to a solenoid. In theory, you are just connecting power on the poles of this relay and the ground line goes from the solenoid right to the power supply. I replaced a bryant humidstat with this one and it worked fine - if that helps.. Will this work with my Lennox Healthy Climate - Model WB@ - 17? Don\\'t know. Is this humidistat compatible with an older GENERALAIRE 1040? Will it replace MHX3 humidistat from GENERALAIRE? I have yet to install sorry. Neither of the 2 humidistats I am looking at (56 and 4655) list humidifier 700M under \"For use with Aprilaire models..........\". So I am looking for a more specific answer. It has two wires to connect, it should work !. Humidistat keeps blowing my furnace breaker. Is this a bad humidistat? Turned to off and the furnace works and water keeps flowing to aprilaire. This humidistat runs off 24V AC and often has it\\'s own step down power supply when the blower board doesn\\'t support it. Check if you are getting 24V AC coming up to the humidistat. The solenoid for the water should be closed unless the blower motor comes on. The transformer is hooked directly at the blower board for aux power 115V. Check your manual for the diagram. If it\\'s blowing the breaker, the blower board is probably detecting a problem with the step down transformer 115 to 24 AC. I\\'d be checking there. The humidistat acts like a light switch and that\\'s just a simple circuit, open or closed. When you turn the knob you can hear it click, that\\'s opening and closing the circuit to directly to the water solenoid. If the solenoid is stuck open, the solenoid is probably blown. The people who installed ours (before we bought the house) hooked it up without the 24V AC step down. 115V directly to the solenoid and poof it\\'s gonna blow. When it blows, its stuck open leaving water constantly flowing. Here are two links to products that are comparable to what I referenced. Hope that helps.

       " \"I'm just wondering where the actual squeak sound comes from? Is it possible that it's doing any permanent damage inside the machine? Hi, Chris. With dryers, a squeak is almost always a sign of damage being done. The only possible exception is if your bearing needs only grease, which means damage is being done but slowly. In order, the three typical places to look for a dryer squeak are: the tension wheel (which holds the belt tight around the drum), the front of the drum (which usually rides on a plastic collar behind the front panel of the dryer, though sometimes rides on two wheels underneath), and, of course, the bearing behind the center of the drum. Usually the cause is obvious. If it's not obvious, it's usually the bearing. Try greasing it if nothing else seems to be the problem. Best of luck.. I have Frigidaire Model #FGX831CS0, and every search states this is the bearing kit model for my Frigidaire dryer-washer combo. Can you confirm this is the right part? I can't confirm it but if all your searches say this is the kit than I would think it is. I would think Frigidaire would pretty much standardize their parts to keep it as simple as possible.

I replaced that valve and that cured the problem.. Isn\\'t this ice maker identical to the Whirlpool 4319743 for $49.50? I do not know. How did you come to this conclusion?. Does the replacement ice maker include the water valve? I have a water overllow problem which forms ice on the side of the icemaker compartment. I don\\'t think so. We just removed the old ice maker, plugged in the electrical and screwed the new ice maker into the place. Didn\\'t come with the wire that turns it off or on either.. Our dimension for the ice maker that is no longer working is 11 3/8\" X 4 5/8\". The dimensions for part # 633324 are larger and doesn\\'t appear to us that it will fit our Norcold 1200 LRIM. Our motor home is a Beaver Patriot manufacture in 2000. I have looked up your model Norcold 1200LRIM and it shows the Norcold 633324 Ice Maker Service Kit as the replacement part.

It is a small tough washer for home use only. Would not recommend for business application. Nor do I believe it is nfs rated. You need a commercial rated pan washer, and even those break down.

Not sure but if the washer works great as it has been doing, after 20 years I am tossing it in the junk.. is it better to use the old copper tube or the new braided &amp; rubber type line &amp; why?? old copper tube is fine as long as you have compression fittings on it but it is just easier to use the new braided s.s. lines for convenience if you have any issues with the dishwasher. also if you move the unit around a lot flexible lines are always better. What is the maximum plate size? I Caroline. I absolutely love this little dishwasher for the mobile home we use in Arizona. It can\\'t take super large plates like my other dishwasher, but it can easily accommodate eight \\'normal\\' dinner-sized plates no problem. ',\n",

Best Wishes, Arielle Beverage Factory 800.710.9939. Does this work with standard kegs? It\\'s hard to answer this question because I do not recall what the \"description\" said when I purchased this product last fall. However, the item(s) I received when I purchased this DO work for a standard keg that you would buy at a liquor store for a party (sanke keg is the technical term I think?). But now as I read the description it specifies \"ball lock\" is included which makes me believe it would only work on corny kegs (old pop kegs used for home brewing...) which is what I use this for. I just needed to spend an extra $10 on the ball lock assembly to convert it. However if you WANTED a party keg attachment instead of ball lock, (assuming the description is correct and you DO receive ball locks) I\\'m not sure how much that would cost in addition. Not sure if this helps at all, but 6 months ago when I bought this I received a party-keg set up.. Haven\\'t used it for a party keg yet but sure is nice to have the option I guess.. What does this warning mean? BUYER BEWARE: Only Beverage Factory sells this genuine Kegco kit as pictured. What\\'s missing if you from someone else? My regulator arrived broken.

Lindy, why don't you go to their website and get the answer? Here it is http://www.iccsafe.org/Pages/default.aspx. does the booster have to be in a certain pos to run If I understand the question (pos meaning position), the unit has rubber feet so I believe it is intended to be upright when running. If you are wondering if it can be installed anywhere along the discharge line from the dryer exit to where the line exits the house, I would guess it would work where you want to install it. You do need power close enough to the electric cord with is probably close to 6 feet. I would suggest installing close to the dryer, if only do you know if it is running when the dryer is on..

It blows hard enough to kill the foliage on a hemlock shrub 6 feet from the discharge ( with a 30 degree cap ) ! It is effective !! DAN. Does this have a vacuum switch that automatically turns the motor on when the dyer turns on? The device runs on a pressure switch that senses increased air pressure in the exhaust line when the dryer comes on. The booster then starts up and shuts off when the dryer turns off.. My vent goes up 8 feet and then horizontal for 15 ft... How will this help locating this at the dryer over what the dryer is already doing?

I love it!. Is the unit light weight enough to install without additional support. I've read comments where some customers had to install wood supports. As long as you can anchor to at least one stud and then used heavy duty drywall anchors for the other attachment points you should be ok.

It has a butterfly on the hood next to the motor. No additional duct work comes with the product. I recommend purchasing 6in duct work from your local hardware store and using solid medal.

       " 'Has anyone purchased this oven recently? I purchased one about three years ago. I have had absolutist no problems with it and I love it. If you are a serious cook, you will love it as well. I love the way I can control the heat of the range and I believe it rivals any gas cook top. I would much prefer the cook top of this range to a gas cook top as the solid surface is easy to maintain, it has warning signals if something boils over and nothing heats up if a pan is not on the surface. I have a very powerful microwave and have done a head to head comparison of bringing water to a boil. This range beats the microwave hands down. In fact, your cooking style will change due to the rapid pace of heating. I love the control I have when making heat sensitive dishes such as gravies, stove top custards and dishes that require high control of heat. The first couple weeks I kept calling my wife over to look at how much better things were cooking up. The ovens are excellent as well. I have not used the lower oven much at all but it would be handy if you are cooking for a large group or need to keep something warm while something else occupies the large oven. Some cool unexpected things regarding this oven is it can be used as a food dryer as well as to proof bread (low heat for yeast breads to rise). The oven has more controls than any mere mortal would ever use. It actually has certain modes for some religious holidays; not making that up. I have seen no downside to the ovens. They are awesome. After three years of use, I truly see no down side to this range at all. I understand that there is a range out there now that will heat a pan no matter where it is placed on the surface. I guess that would be cool but probably would not change the way I cook at all. I highly suggest this range. It would get 6 stars on a 5 star scale.. I currently have a stand alone range. Can the slide in work in the same 30\" slot in the kitchen counter? Maybe. If you have flat counters like granite then it might work. The edge if your counter may need to be flat and not curve up too. There may be accessories to accommodate the curve but you\\'d have check on electrolux\\'s website. There should be a fitment guide pdf guide there. The main concern is the slide in is designed slide over the counter so its nearly flush with the counter. If you have tile with a round edge on the left and right if the stove you won\\'t be able to get the stove top flat with the counters and it won\\'t look right. Even if you satisfy the flat countertop requirement, you will ideally want a small strip of countertop behind the stove to fill the gap between the backsplash and the back of the stove. Slide in ranges are designed to look like counter top stoves and the trim piece on the stove is designed to be flush with the countertop on 3 sides (left, behind, right). Although I\\'ve seen optional accessories for placing a \"dummy\" filler piece behind the stove to fill the gap on back, you\\'d have to check the website or ask an appliance retailer. With all that being said, I would just buy the Electrolux free standing induction version if that is the stove/counter configuration you have now. It will be a direct replacement. Check electrolux\\'s website.. How do I purchase a warranty for this product? I purchased an extended warranty through Sears. We love the stove. It is an outstanding product and the induction technology is amazing.. how to use the built in cooking timer it\\'s a little weird. There are two of them, one above the other. just touch it and type the minutes then either touch it again or his start, I forget. It will not shut off the oven, it\\'s just a timer and it\\'s not that loud. I prefer the one on my iphone.. How can we repair the E15 error code? I had the E15 problem. The range would do nothing but beep in an annoying tone. E15 is not something that most owners can take care of. I called the tech from Sears, who replaced a circuit board and it started working again. The way it looks, E15 can be caused by a range of issues. Only a qualified tech can find out the real problem, and fix it. As I have said before, purchase the extended warranty for this range - chances are very high that you will need it. FWIW, this range is an absolute delight to work with when it works (That is my way of saying it is aggravating when it doesn\\'t.). What is the experience controling top heat with the touch panel (no knob)? Works great, I had no problems with it.. ',\n",
       " \"Does it have the ability to just start the dryer for a short time to help remove wrinkles in the morning if starting a load before going to bed? Yes, the dryer portion has the option to dry after washing and rinsing or rinsing and drying without the wash. But it also has dry only which btw is by steam so it does take out wrinkles. I have not used it in this manner before as I usually wash, rinse and dry. Oh, it also does have a wash/rinse without drying for things that you would need to hang dry. It is a pretty sweet unit and have not had any proplems after two years.. Does it come with hose Yes, it came with everything needed to set it up; even a special wrench to work specifically on the set up of the combo. The only extra thing you'll need to make sure you have on-hand is the HE (high efficiency) detergent. Oh, and dryer sheets don't work; you'll need a liquid softener if you use the stuff.. Can it be portable like the 2.7 model with its extra weight? No, I think it's way too large to be called portable. Also, it needs stability or it vibrates badly. Got to tell you I love the machine though!. This looks like a great washer/dryer combo: But is it vented or not? Have read about these & would love to get one. I live in an old house (100+yrs) & I'm concerned about: 1.) the need for a level floor, and 2.) more importantly, the amount of vibration. I can just imagine the whole house shaking. Does anyone have experience or suggestions dealing with either issue?. What is the inside diameter of the dain line? 7/8 inch. Can this be programmed to wash and then dry? Meaning if I set it to wash &amp; dry when I leave, will it be dry when I return? Or do I have to set it to dry after wash cycle? Yes, you can program it to immediately dry after the wash cycle is done.. does this combo have to be installed in a drain pan. Does all of the water discharged from the washer go out the hose or is a secondary drain required No. It drains through the drain hose into a drain pipe just like a regular washer. This includes the dryer condensate. The only time you will have water POSSIBLY draining onto the floor would be when cleaning the filter. About a quart of water drains from the filter. I use a large rond pan that is about 1 1/2 inches high to catch that water when I clean the filter.. how long during the washer and dryer? From the time I put in load to taking out dry anywhere between 1 1/2 - 3 hours, depending on cycle.. With the door open, what is the height from the bottom of the opening in the front of the dryer to the floor? 15.5 inches from floor to bottom of opening.. Does this dryer have a steam dry capability to remove wrinkles? No but you can somewhat duplicate this function by running a quick wash cycle (set SOIL LEVEL to light) with drying. I've done this. Or you can run a dry-only cycle with a wet towel inside.. \",\n",

Do you have to have a down draft with this cooktop? Sorry, No down draft with this cooktop.. Up to what size diam pot can i use on the medium sized burner? The plates/burners work with pots that are about 50% of their size and larger. So if the pot has a diam larger than the burner, only the section on the induction plate gets heated by the burner. A very large pot/griddle that spans two burners can be heated by both burners.. Does it have built-in downdraft ventilation? no. how much clearance below unit Dear Bubby Bob, Bosch\\'s installation manual does not mention any specific clearance below the cooktop. They recommend at least 2 inches around the sides and back of the unit and 2.24 to the front. Any cabinets above should be at least 30 inches above the surface. You may want to contact Bosch directly or you can call our sales department at1-888-768-1710 and they can call Bosch on your behalf to check on any recommendation.. do I need ventilation with an induction cooktop? Yes. Look for range hoods on appliancehippo.com. Thank you.. How much electricity does this use compared to a regular electric cooktop? I guess I can answer this 3 ways... (1) It should be a drop-in replacement for existing conventional cooktop; it uses 220V and 40A (or maybe 30A -- check the manual) (2) I\\'d guess it is slightly more efficient because it doesn\\'t have to heat anything but the pot. There\\'s some inefficiency in the induction mechanism, but I\\'d guess this is less than the inefficiency of heating the air and whatnot around a conventional electric element. (3) I wouldn\\'t worry about your electric bill. It\\'s not going to be noticeably different than conventional electric, and, even if you are blazing away at 6000 watts (4 burners going full) you are looking at less than $1/hour at the worst of USA electric rates. Do the math on, say, boiling 4 quarts of water and you\\'ll see it\\'s a few pennies.. What type of pans do I need ? Induction-compatible cookware contains ferromagnetic materials - in other words, it contains iron, or has a layer with magnetic properties. Cast iron, enamel cast iron and most types of stainless steel cookware are all induction compatible (But not all types - for instance, All-Clad\\'s MC2 line, which is made of aluminum and stainless steel, is not induction compatible). Aluminum, copper or glass cookware will not work unless they have a layer on the bottom with magnetic properties. To tell if a pot or pan is induction-compatible, hold a magnet to the bottom. If it clings, the cookware will work on an induction cooktop. Also, many manufacturers have started putting a n \"induction compatible\" symbol on the bottom of their cookware or they\\'ll note compatibility on their packaging. The symbol often looks like a horizontal zig-zag or a coil. If you have an induction cooktop, but a favorite piece of cookware doesn\\'t work on it, don\\'t fret - Mauviel makes a product called the Mauviel Induction Disc (Compare Prices), which can be placed on the cooktop under the pan; the heating reaction will then heat the contents of the pan.

You can get replacement filters from Broan I believe.. does this item come with the power cord? do we need to purchase any thing else to make sure it works? It doesn\\'t come with the power cord. is it remote control No, it does not have a remote control trol.. can this be used with ducted system? It can be used with a ducted system. There are limitations to how far it will push, but it has accommodations for top or rear exhaust on the body. My range is on an outside wall of the house so I used a rectangular vent kit to duct it outside. 4\"x10\" is the size I believe.. do you have to use halogen lights or can you substitute LED? you can get GU10 leds with the same pin contacts..

       " 'I ordered the light bulbs listed but they stick out the bottom. I was expecting them to be flush. Is this \"Normal\"? The bulbs, regardless of wattage are the same dimension and stick out ~1/8\" (4mm) from the plane of the sheet metal. If they didn\\'t do that, it would be tough to get them out.. I love mine but one of the lights keeps burning out why? I purchased my Broan on July 5, 2013. I have yet to replace the bulbs and they usually stay on all night. I purchased the bulbs here on Amazon but cant find them here anymore. I can only think that one port is tossing out to much power and causing it to pop. I had the same problem with an outdoor light. I would need to replace them monthly. I ended up buying higher end Cree bulbs and it has been close to 2 years without replacing them. Try buying one good bulb and see if it lasts. Good luck!. Can you turn the fan off yourself or does it turn off by itself? The fan as well as the light is strictly manual, in other words you have to turn it off and on yourself.. This is a re-circulating fan correct? Does it need charcaol filter? Yes, there is a replaceable charcoal filter.. can this hood be vented out the wall? Yes, you have that option.. ',\n",

My unit works perfectly well, non-ducted, using the specified charcoal filters (which reduce air flow, and are not included) over my six burner induction stove. The unit is NOT commercial quality but is quite high end for a residential hood. The installation was not difficult - the unit has worked flawlessly for 3 months.. Do all lights need to be on at the same time, or can fewer/less light be used? Where do you buy replacement bulbs? The lights are all on at the same time. There are, however, three different light intensity settings.. Can this hood be ducted horizontally through a wall? Does not appear to be possible just based on the design and installation method.. How loud does it get? Really pretty quiet!. Is this a plug in or does it require hard wiring? hard wiring - which should already be in-place if there is any kind of hood there. whats the diameter of the hood? It\\'s a rectangular unit so it has no diameter. The horizontal length is 30\", it comes out about 21\" to 22\" from the back wall and it measures about 8\" down.. 80% sure I\\'ll vent it outdoors, BUT if I choose ductless, has anyone noticed if exhaust from top of unit discolors white cabinetry? No. I live in a cold snowy climate. Will venting it outdoors allow a bit of cold air to seep in when fan is not in operation? No. ',\n",

If you need more information on this please call 1-800-456-4669. Is there a Shabbath mode? Yes: In the manual on Page 13 it says: To Set the Sabbath Feature (for use on the Jewish Sabbath & Holidays) The Bake time and Start time pads are used to set the Sabbath feature. The Sabbath feature may only be used with the BAKE pad. The oven temperature may be set higher or lower after setting the Sabbath feature (the oven temperature adjustment feature should be used only during Jewish Holidays), however the display will not visibly show or provide any audible tones indicating whether the change occurred correctly. Once the oven is properly set using Bake with the Sabbath feature active, the oven will remain continuously ON until cancelled. This will override the factory preset 12-Hour Energy Saving feature. If the oven light will be needed during the Sabbath, press Oven light pad before activating the Sabbath feature. Once the oven light is turned ON and the Sabbath feature is active, the oven light will remain ON until the Sabbath feature is turned OFF. If the oven light needs to be OFF, be sure to turn the oven light OFF before activating the Sabbath feature. IMPORTANT NOTES: It is not advised to attempt to activate any other program feature other than BAKE while the Sabbath feature is active. ONLY the following key pads will function after setting the Sabbath feature; UP or DOWN ARROW, BAKE, START & CLEAR/OFF pads. ALL OTHER KEYPADS will not function once the Sabbath feature is properly activated. To Program the Oven to Begin Baking Immediately & activate the Sabbath feature 1. Be sure that the clock is set with the correct time of day. 2. Place the food in the oven. 3. Press Bake pad. \"---\" will appear, \"UPPER\" and \"bake \" will flash in the display. 4. Press the Up or Down arrow pad until the desired temperature appears. \"UPPER\" and \"BAKE\" will flash in the display. 5. Press Start pad or wait 5 seconds. \"UPPER\" and \"BAKE\" stop flashing and the icon will appear in the display. 6. If you desire to set the oven control for a Timed Bake or Delayed Start Bake do so at this time. If not, skip this step and continue to step 7. Refer to the Timed Bake (complete steps 6-8) / Delayed Start Bake (complete steps 6-11) section for complete instructions. Remember the oven will shut down after using Timed Bake or Delay Start Bake and therefore may only be used once during the Sabbath/Jewish Holidays. The maximum Delayed Start Bake time is 11 hours & 59 minutes. 7. The oven will turn ON and begin heating..

It is best if the can is already cold, and will keep it cool fairly well. How much noise does it make? I don\\'t know because it never fuctioned.. ',\n",

How fast will it fill an empty basket with ice? Ice starts being made in a few minutes but it will probably take an hour for the basket to fill. What is the capacity of the basket the ice is held in? In other words how much ice does the basket hold? I understand it makes 28lbs total. If I had to guess about a pound of ice. You have to keep in mind it makes 9 cubes at a time. It will take a bit to fill the bin and it will melt and the water is recaptured and re freezes it cannot store ice for a long period. It makes a batch of ice ever few minutes depending on the size of cubes you want. We find that we can make enough ice to fill an ice bucket and then we let the machine go at its regular capacity and have had ample ice for a small gathering of about 10 people.. Ship to argentina? Yes will cost about $250. Does this ice maker make the nugget ice like they use at Sonic? It makes ice shaped like bullets, small medium and large thickness for about 7 months then it died.. How much water does it hold? This is the worst product I\\'ve ever purchased and broke after 1 month of use. The amount of water it holds is irrelevant - you should stay far away from this horrible product.. ',\n",

I went to lowe\\'s and asked about it, they said its the same exact filter they just changed the last letter just to update it. But, yes, it is compatible..

From what I have seen, this filter fits most Samsung Refrigerators that use the cartridge type filters.. Last 2 filters we bought \"lasted\" almost exactly 6 months. Is our usage that consistent? Or does the change filter light come on every six months? My samsung light sometime goes 7 -8 months.before lighting and we use it a lot even fill the coffee pot everyday.

I\\'m sure I have put at least 7 pairs in it. It is a real work horse.. do I need to buy the 4 yr warranty since speed queen has a good warranty on their machines? The factory warranty is for 3 years, so you would gain little by buying that..... does this have a stainless steel tub? Yes it does.. differences in models, how well agitators work, spin speeds etc I think the difference I models is the extra rinse option. The inside drum is pretty large but as with all washing machines you don\\'t want to overload it. I have had the one with the extra rinse option for 6 months and absolutely love my washer.. can i make water level go higher permanatley on new speed queen top load washer since water restrictions on new washer Yes.

What\\'s the Rpm on the spin cycle? Not sure & don\\'t remember seeing it in the manual. It definitely is not as fast as the new high tech machines & things do come out damper which can affect dry time. However they also don\\'t come out as wrinkled or tangled. Energy wise I don\\'t see a real negative to this as the longest wash cycle takes about &#8531; the time as the shortest wash cycle on a high tech, so the extra dry time prob still uses less energy overall to wash & dry.. Can I use HE laundry soap in my new Speed Queen top load washer without causing any harm? Yes. Almost all detergent is now marked HE. We are using it in our washer and have been for weeks in our older one we just got rid of. Additionally, the new HE detergent is made to have less suds, since the new washers use less water and more enzymes to break down the dirt. So you would only need to be concerned if you had a new HE washer and put too much soap in your wash, as your clothes wouldn\\'t be free of the soap at the end. The main thing we will all notice by using HE stamped detergent is less suds in our traditional top loader.. ',\n",

       " 'Which is better for delicates and to get out Stains, this or a Manual Washboard?? Will a washboard wear out my clothes but get them cleaner? The MobileWasher\\'s delicate cycle generates it\\'s power from precise wrist action. While cocking the wrist and utilizing a \"GI Joe\" type hand grip the user can accurately desoil most fine fabrics. Heavier soiling however requires a looser, more modified dual wrist action that is best used in combination with a \"Kung foo\" style grip. Full on elbow motion only enhances the efficiency on this stain setting. An open leg stance with hip sway AND full back arching are required to attain a vigorous agitation cycle. In either case, this washer\\'s shaft is sturdy, rock hard, smooth and comfortable to grip. This alone easily separates it from the barbarian like action of a washboard, thus making it an efficient, caring washer for all your filthy fabrics.. Can you use it in a clean utility sink? (Laundry sink) It seems like that would be easy to drain and refill for rinsing, but is it too big? Are you asking if the sink is too big? I don\\'t think so - seems some folks just use the bathtub! I measured the plastic tub I use (which I put in the bathtub) - it is a 12\"x17\" rectangle that is 12\" deep. I can wash a load of undies, or a couple shirts and slacks or a queen sheet in the tub without even filling it clear up. I would think if you use a laundry sink, which might be bigger, you would just keep the water more shallow. You can tell when you have the water high enough to plunge the clothes around easily. In fact, I was just reading the newer reviews here and I like the idea of putting a laundry basket inside the washing tub so you can lift out the clothes to empty the water. You could certainly do that inside a laundry tub! Also, I just did a couple loads yesterday and am still enjoying the mobile washer - short handle and all. My handle has not loosened, but I\\'m sure I can fix it if it does. I really do like this device - it keeps my inner hippy chick alive in my social security aged body!. How do you use this portable washing machine? You simply put your dirty clothes in a sink, tub or bucket with a small amount of water and detergent (enough to cover them), place the MobileWasher on top of them and move it up and down. After a few minutes when the clothes are clean you put them in clean water and repeat the up and down motion in order to rinse the dirty water and detergent out. Do a quick search on Youtube and you\\'ll find a number of how-to videos.. How do you dry your clothes after using this? Do you ring them dry with your hands and then hang them? Hanging them outside to dry is the best way. A mechanical wringer would get them dry enough for an automatic dryer, but good ones are not cheap or readily available. While hand-wringing sort of works on woven fabrics, it\\'s not a good idea for knits because they get stretched out of shape. Debbie is right about the dripping, and it\\'s hard to wring heavy fabrics like denim jeans. Knit sweaters and tops can be squeezed to get much of the water out, and if you wrap a clean dry towel around them you can squeeze out even more, then hang the towel to dry with the rest of the laundry.. is this really easier and/or more effective than just agitating the laundry with your hands or stomping with your feet? If you only have a couple of small items such as underwear, it is just as easy to use your hands. However, if you have larger items such as sheets, towels, and regular clothing it is easier and more efficient with the MobileWasher. I absolutely love mine.. How big a bucket should be to use this washer? Of course bucket... (This was auto correction.... which annoys me) I have two buckets that I believe are 3 gallon size. It does work in them, and since I am using them to wash cloth diapers it helps me to keep the number lower to clean, but I think a 5 gallon bucket would be better. I highly recommend this washer. I use it to prewash the diapers since our machine is an HE type--low water and diapers does NOT mix--but have also used it on other items that I needed without wanting to do a full machine load and it was great.. I\\'m thinking of doing this in my bathtub. Could I rig it with a broom stick for length? I have a bad back. Does your broomstick have a screw thread? Because you need to screw the stick into the cone. The circumference of the thread from the stick it comes with is 2 & 3/8 inches. The width and space between each thread is 1/8 inch. I tried it in the bathtub and it does not work as well as in the 5 gallon bucket. Actually, you will do more energy work in the bathtub. In the bucket, you don\\'t use as much energy and the MobileWasher is more powerful with the suction and pushing air and water through the clothes to make them very clean, better than the washer machine.. Does anyone have a copy of the instruction sheet? Don\\'t know about instructions. Just be aware that a small amount of detergent is enough. Two or three small pieces of clothing is plenty. A five gallon paint bucket is fine. Just agitate to your hearts content. Use lots of water for rinsing. A little fabric softener in the final rinse works ok. One item at a time is ideal but not water wise. It works in a pinch but no blankets and sheets.. 1) Where can I get free water bucket? 2) Should I get a prop 65 bucket that I seen at a 99 cents store? Thanks! Yes any bucket will work as long as it is wider than a plunger. But you can often get the buckets at menards, lowes, home depo, walmart or even grocery stores that have deli you can ask the manager sometimes they will give them to you or sell them dirt cheap.. How is this better than just using a regular plunger? It works better and more simply. We tried a regular plunger and it just didn\\'t compare.. ',\n",

Unfortunately, Electrolux does not mention removing the entire ice maker, or provide any instructions that would indicate you can do so. However, you can turn off the unit and remove the bin which would give you a bit more space.. What is the front of the door made of,,,aluminum stainless steel other? The doors are Stainless Steel.. does this fridge have one of those shelves that could slide in to make space for taller items like the ge space saver shelf? Unfortunately this does not.. Does anyone have problems with the ice being knocked out of the ice box when opening the freezer? Yea, just need to reach back and knock the ice forward, then when it gets full, push the wire sensor all the way up to shut it off until it gets low, then put it back down to turn it back on. Not a problem. What year of manufacture is this refrigerator? This is a current model!. Does this fridge have an on/off switch for the ice maker? Hi Satesh, Yes this icemaker has an onoff switch and also offers a locking option that would allow you to leave the ice maker on but control the access to the ice maker. Please feel to call us at 888-768-1710 if you have any other questions. Melanie with Goedeker's. How has this refrigerator been working out for you? Any regrets? couldn't be better. If I had one complaint it is that the ice maker takes up 1/4 of the freezer space. It does work very well though. We just bought a little chest freezer at Costco for about $160 and that solved our need for more freezer space. Other than that it is quiet as a mouse and works perfect. I recommend it.. \",\n",

Hope this helps. will this part work for Model LE7810XPN0? there should be some old numbers on the old element, and there should be numbers here you cross over to this number. You may have to do a search elsewhere for the cross reference numbers, but if you put the numbers from your old element in a search, it should lead you to if this will work.

Anyone know if this pump will work on it (they look identical in pics) I believe that it will work.. how does pump come off 2 clips hold it on to the motor. The motor shaft slides out of the pump. Does it fit on kenmore washer series 90? Possibly....but the best way to ensure it's correct is to get the model number off of the washer then go to www.searspartsdirect.com and find the part number for the pump. The model number is located on a tag just under the lid at the back of the washer. An alternative would be to pull the old part and get the number off of it. For what it's worth I installed this on an 80 series.. Does this come with the two clips to attach it? No. You have to use existing clips or find them online or at an appliance store.. Who makes this part? Not sure, but it was a perfect fit for my washer.. What kind of warrenty does this part have? I bought this part on 10/25/14 and it has a crack in the plastic that has started to leak water. We bought two, both of which immediately began leaking from the top. (Which was our problem to begin with.) We paid so little for the part, (under $20) that we didn't bother with the return. What we did was put glue on the top which was leaking and it has worked just fine. Its been about 3 months.. will it fit a 70 series model? Thanks The best thing to do is to remove the one from the washer and compare it with The one that you want to buy that's what I did.. Do the last numbers matter? My pump part says 3363394, but the 2nd set of numbers don't match, and my repair manual only mentions the first set. My #s were off by a few too. I do not recall which ones because it was so long ago. I do recall being concerned aboutit, but the pumps looked the same. It all worked out fine. Look at the shape, and the bolt hole placement.. Is the part number the one in the picture or the one in the listing title - Water Pump 3363394 3348015 The one listed on the list and when you get it in the mail you'll see there's a decal with that part on the other side of that pump. \",\n",
       " 'How do you install it to get it watertight? Looked for youtube videos - no luck! You just shove the water line in, easy as that, it\\'s amazing. I\\'ve used about 6 of them and they all work perfectly, no drips. Its a snug fit but there\\'s more to it than that. The openings are actually tapered like a funnel, just ever so slightly, and it also has a spring loaded mechanism that prevents the tubing from being pulled out accidentally. If you do however need to remove the already in-place water line simply press down firmly on the spring loaded collar ( you\\'ll see what I\\'m talking about once you have it in your hands of you decide to but it) and gently pull out on the water line simultaneously. It\\'s magical :). Hi, can you tell me about shipping charges if I want to order 5 pieces? We offer free shipping.. Will this work on a refrigerator water line? Yes it works on 1/4\" tubing like you find on a refrigerator line, that is what I am using it for.. Description says 1/4 OD, does this mean it will receive a 1/4 OD tubing? Yes that\\'s exactly what it means.. Is the valve air tight? Can it be used in a low pressure air system? I have only experience with water application,it is a strong little valve,my water pressure exceeds 60 psi and have had no issues in 8 months. is this good to use with the type of 1/4 Polyethylene tubing that they use for reverse osmosis systems?? Yes, it\\'s designed for that tubing and I use a couple of these on my RO system.. Can this product be used on 1/4 copper refrigerator lines? Yes, works on copper or plastic.

It fits perfectly, it does not over heat around the element and the stove is protected from my big canner sitting on it with the excess heat. I love it! I am going to buy a 2nd for the other big burner to cann on.. How do I know which one will fit my stove and work properly? This fits all stoves, except GE and Hotpoint, which have special connections and are harder to find and usually costs over $100. I had a GE so researched this thoroughly and could not afford to put that kind of money out. Now I have a Kenmore (basically a Whirlpool) and this generic one works great and affordable too!. Our stove is a Frigidaire? Will this element work on it? The box lists Frigidaire on it. It has the two prong connection.. Will this burner fit a GE oven Model JB650DFCC? I found your model on the GE website and it is a smooth top range. This canner element is for a range that has individual elements that you can put in and take out. According to what I saw on the website, your range comes with a large burner and a hot burner, so it will probably work for canning unless the manual says not to use it for canning. If you want a separate canner element, look up hot plates for canning on Amazon. Some have good reviews.. I have a GE Spectra electric stove......will this fit my appliance? If so, I'm buying TWO!!! the one i bought fits most stoves but will not fit GE. Check with Range Kleen who made my element. They have a websight. I have a small Hotpoint tove and the picture looks JUST like my element. will this fit my stove?? I don't see Hotpoint listed on the box. But it is an 8 inch plug in type element. Check on www.rangekleen.com Hopefully you can get the information there. I love this element. Raises canner up off the stove.. Does this burner kit work in whirlpool ranges? Thank you. I have a whirlpool super capacity 465 and it works great. So I would presume that it would fit other whirlpool ranges but that I don't know about for sure.

To me it sounds like there is no problem with the faucet itself, but maybe the beer is over carbonated if you force carbonated your beer or your serving pressure may be too high. I\\'d try turning off the co2 and purging the keg, then reset the pressure from about 5-10 psi and go from there. If the beer ends up being over carbonated, I\\'d purge the pressure off again and let it sit without any pressure on it for a day or two and see if it mellows out any.. I just hooked mine up for the first time and beer is spraying everywhere out of the holes where the faucet screws onto the shank. Any thoughts? Chek the black oring, it must be not as it should be, do you have the faucet tool?. This looks like pretty solid metal tap. It does not look as though it is easily opened &amp; closed by one hand. How do you actually use it? It works fine with one hand, but you need an additional part: either a hand pump (\"picnic pump\") or a CO2 source. One or the other is required to pressurize the keg, after which tipping the handle is easily done with one hand while the other holds the cup.. ',\n",

       " 'repairs I had the same problem and went on line and found there are several yahoo.tube and I think some YouTube videos that show how to do get to the chopper to unclog, repair, or replace it. It\\'s not too involved and even if your mechanical abilities are moderate, you should be OK. If you are a total klutz then pay the repair guys or replace the unit. And if you are fairly good at that stuff it should take between 15 and 30 minutes. In any case no previous dishwasher knowledge is necessary. I learned that one thing that wrecks the chopper is paper (usually from paper labels on jars or containers). It gets partially disintegrated from the water and soap and as the paper bits go through the chopper they ball up which get between the blades and push them off the shaft. Good luck. BTW: KithenAid, Kenmore, and Whirlpool dishwashers are all made by Whirlpool. The interiors of all those units appear to be the same with the same repair procedures.. May I know the made of origin? My Kitchen Aid dish washer is made by Whirlpool, I assume they all are. In terms of where they are made, I don\\'t know for sure but believe they are made in the US.. Do the wine glass holders work well? Is it gentle on china? No, the wine glass holders didn\\'t work well for us. A couple failed (as did another plastic part), and they rapidly lost their flex.

This refrigerator has a defective ice maker. There is a class action lawsuit in effect for it. You can probably find it on line. Frigidaire is made by Electrolux and they have very similar unit that is also in the suit.. The upper ice maker drips water through the door dispenser. Repair service has put seals all around the ice maker twice. How do you get this fixed? I didn\\'t. I replaced this sub-standard fridge with an LG.. control panel for ice reads 1c with E in upper right handcorner I don\\'t know what that means but the icemaker in this refridgerator is the worst in every way. Mine is 2 years old and I can\\'t tell you how many times the repair people have been to my house to try and fix it. Even when it works it barely makes enough ice for a two person household.. will not dispense water thru door? Assuming you don\\'t have a problem with the water supply to the refrigerator and the filter is clean, the water line is probably frozen. It runs behind the ice maker mechanism and that section is known to ice up. It\\'s a known issue and part of the myriad of issues with this unit that go wrong.. fan ices up stops working in ice maker model fghb2866pf2 I have no clue. I assume you have ice maker in fridge. Mine quit working a few days after warranty expired. After a little research, I find that many have problems with this ice maker. Frigidaire response, \"TOUGH\". I did find ice in the fan. No idea why. Used a hair dryer to melt it. I do not use the ice maker anymore.. Has anyone had a problem with the front of the crisper drawer coming off? where do you find a replacement drawer for this model? No problem with crisper. Has anyone had problems with ice maker in fridge, not in freezer. Mine is a piece of junk.. Why does fridge dispensed water smell and taste bad? May need to change filter. I have this piece of crap fridge. Ice maker quit working right after warranty expired. Ice maker is a well known problem to Frigidaire and they will not do anything. Better of buying cheap brand with old type ice maker.. There is no ice coming out of the door dispenser and I can\\'t pull out the ice bin. It seems stuck, or is there a latch that I need to pull or press? Couple of things here...........It sounds like you did not use the ice maker regularly. Is there ice in the tray? Is the door dripping from melting ice? Does that tray appear heavy, if yes there is ice in the tray. If there is ice in the tray then it is likely a solid piece of ice has formed, preventing the tray from sliding out or jammed in the door.. if there is water leaking from dispenser what do you do? Long term I have not heard of an actual fix that works to make this refrigerator\\'s ice maker reliable. That is why I have joined the class action suit mentioned in earlier posts. Short term this is what I did. I shut off the ice maker, defrosted the ice maker section with a blow dryer (to speed up the defrosting of the ice buildup in the back.) In my case I had ice build up in the back of the unit which caused it to malfunction. I used towels to sop up the water as it melted. This became tedious as it kept recurring.

Can the dryer shelf be set at different heights? I\\'m short and need it lower than 51\". We adjusted the shelf by buying 4 hose clamps to allow the shelf to be sturdy and lower. The cost was minimal and has worked great for us. You can get them at Home Depot or Lowes.. How wide and how high is this? I thought the dimensions were on the description but it is 51 1/4\" tall and 21\" deep at the base, 13 1/2\" deep at the top and 28 1/4\" wide.. Does the dryer need to be mounted to the wall or is it safe just sitting on the shelf? It doesn\\'t shift position or fall off if not mounted to wall? I\\'ve had mine just sitting on the shelf for about a year. It moves a little but it\\'s safe!. If this is \"meant\" to be used with an Avanti dryer that\\'s cited on amazon as being 17.3\" D, how does the the 13.5\" D top shelf support the dryer? (Note: We have the Sonya dryer that\\'s actually 21.2\" in depth, I\\'m wondering if there\\'s any way we\\'ll be... The Avanti dryer has built-in \"nut\" type openings on the bottom. The \"bolt\" legs screw into the bottom through the top shelf wires thus the dryer is mounted to the top shelf. The shelf itself is secured against the back wall so that both dryer and shelves are secure. It has worked well for us.. Does the stand itself have brackets to attach the stand to the wall? And if so, where exactly are the located? I don\\'t remember exactly where they\\'re located, because I ended up selling my stand last year when I moved to another home with laundry attached - but yes, there are brackets to bolt the entire unit to the wall (all the way to the studs, I believe).. Does this stand fit the Sonya SYD-60E dryer? No, it\\'s not deep enough by a few inches because that is the larger 13lb Sonya dryer. That shelf was designed for the 8.8lb Avanti dryer that is about the same size as the Sonya SYD-40E. I previously owned the Avanti and used with the stand. Now I have the Sonya SYD-60E and had to build a custom shelf in my laundry closet because this model is both taller and deeper and too big for the shelf. It does fit the smaller Sonya model SYD-40E. Hope this helps.. Does this fit over a regular size washer? It will fit over a small one , not a high one. You can put it over a small one and and use the shelf on top for soap. I was very pleased with this purchase.. Do you need tools to put this thing together? Just a wrench to tighten the bolts. Will the Panda portable washer and dryer fit on this stand? The sonya washer and SMALL sonya dryer will fit perfectly. I can\\'t comment on Panda.. ',\n",

As long as the original one is identical to this one ie: same label plate specs it will work. what could replace a modern maid wall oven gas safety valve #nc-4111-5 y-30128-35af , however it comes standard with a natural gas orifice. It is rated for natural gas or propane. I do believe the nc-4111-5s came with a propane orifice. You would have to swap your original orifice with the one that comes on the valve ( if you have LP ) The orifice is the brass fitting that fits inside the open end of the burner tube.. My frid wall oven has valve 3203702 will this valve work for my oven The only answer I can give is look at valve # 3203702 then compare it with the specs on range valve Y-30128-35A and see if it matches . I can not give any more information pertaining to your case . I will say that if the two do appear to be similar in appearance then it is a good bet that it will work . If not then it probably isn\\'t worth the trouble to try it .. Is this valve for use on an LP stove The valve is for use on either LP or NG but you may need to take the orifice (or nipple) off your old valve if the holes are different sizes. will this part work on my Hotpoint oven? There are only three things that are needed for this to work . One is the internal resistance, second is the electrical connector, and last is the mounting holes or clips . The last two can be adjusted to fit your range ( I had to use the old connector ) without any adverse effects . The internal resistance is something that can not be changed . I have been told that they are all in the same range but I can not state that as an absolute . The fact that the part is about $50 to $ 100 cheaper than what anyone else is asking is a good reason to gamble on the part . If you do not alter it in any way it can still be returned for a refund if inoperable . The only thing that might be altered is the connector that plugs into it and that is in the wiring not in the part . I would suggest that you take off the bottom pan in your oven ( normally 4 screws ) and look to see if the old part matches the one in the picture . It is not difficult and is straightforward to replace even though the instructions are a little \" sketchy \" .

Looking to fix my Tappan oven. 76423223/08011-85029375. Thank you! I do not know if the part in question will actually work with a Tappan oven . The best answer I can give is to look at the one in your oven and see if it resembles the one pictured . They all work on the same principle and it is mostly the gas in size ( NPT thread size ) and the electrical connections that will determine if it will fit your range or not . The other determining factor is the internal resistance that triggers the valve to open but I do think that the values are the same . The best I can say is try it and see . If the original looks the same it probably is .. Hello- does this part have a UL listing?

Unit is very heavy duty, the same as an electric range. 40 lbs. is a helluva heavy cookware. I think it will do it, how many times, I don't know.. Can the coil be removed or lifted up to clean the drip tray? Yes. The element lifts up and the drip pan can be removed and cleaned. The unit is mostly commercial grade stainless steel and very easy to keep clean.. Will it hold a temp. Say 180 F? Or will there be a fuxuation going up and down to maintain a temp? The temperature is accurate as any stove top with the same tungsten elements. They will fluctuate, it's the nature of the material. But my experience is that it will fluctuate between my Temperature and +2 degrees. The unit is very well built, light-weight, sturdy and strong. It has a 3 foot power cord with a ground prong. The case is made of Stainless Steel and it stands off the counter top approximately 5/8 of an inch. It has an Indicator light to show the heat cycle is turned on and the light will go off when the cycle is done. With a fast cycle, it maintains the heat setting very well. However, if your looking to add this to your Science Laboratory to maintain constant temperature at precisely 180 degrees ... or your experiment will fail.. then look elsewhere. Otherwise this is a fine product for anything else you want to cook.

       " 'Can it be installed directly in the water line without any additional shutoffs or pressure valves? I have a limited amount of space to install this. I would NOT recommend installing without the shut and bypass valves. It\\'s not a question of IF you need to replace the filter, but when you need to replace, you got to shut the water off near the filter to do it. Or else you\\'ll have water spewing out everywhere. Even if you shut the main line off outside once you remove the filter, all the water left in the line will come gushing out...don\\'t do it. Put the valves in. Pressure gauges are not necessary, but the shut-off valves are.. Does it filter out flouride? No. Just solids and chlorine as far as the package says. I think you need RO for that.. Does the filter include a cartridge? The filter is integrated into the cartridge. It is not separate. There are replacements available on Amazon and usually last 1 year of use.. How often does the filter need to be changed on an AP903 when it is used only 4 months a year I don\\'t think there is a good, simple answer to this question. The life of the carbon block media is dependent mostly on your specific water quality. In other words, the worse your input water is, the less it will last. Still, even this is an oversimplification as different types of contaminate will effect the carbon media differently. This is all to say that this particular filter may only last 4 months if your property is using a non-municipal water source (i.e. well water). Perhaps if your use is so irregular, maybe looking into one of the more simple, standard, 10 or 20\" filter housings would be best. Big box hardware stores will usually have 10\" carbon block or GAC filters in stock and you could simply change the filter at any time. In any case I would recommend changing out the filter prior to first use after its sat for 8 months unused. Carbon block filters, even ones with anti-bacteria additives, can build up dangerous amounts of bacteria given enough time (and I think 8 months is more than enough). Carbon filters that have sat in stale water for that long should be changed out (and filter housings cleaned with bleach if applicable) prior to consuming any water from that system.. Does this filter out radon? No. radon gas must have a a high efficiency filter- formerly known as \"HEPA\". How ever if you have particulates that give off radon, it captures those. Capture is dependent on the filter pore size- info I do not have at hand right now. Thus if you are fitering water from a well it would reduce the radon due to reduced particles. Not because it can capture gases. Most filters that use charcoal can capture radon gas, but they have a very limited life span. ( of course the more water you filter the shorter the life span.). I have a strong sulphur odor in my cold water(on a well). Will your filter remove this? It does appear to remove sulphur, but our levels may not be the same as yours. This is a very easy and simple filter to install and change. I would not recommend as a replacement for a salt-based system, but rather as a secondary filter.. how is the apif 300 iron remover filter system? The AP903 works well for a boat supplied by pier water. Clean taste and adequate flow.. Several people provided bad reviews for the filters not working after a few days. Why did they not last? Wanted a little extra installed a AP903 and AP801C in series with the latter first in February and couldn\\'t be happier. This is on a well and haven\\'t touched since installation---. How is this system for ferrous iron and metallic ordors? The system works very Well. Except if you live in a place like on Long Island with high iron and metallic odor, it will work great but start to get stuffed up after 6 months, and you start losing pressure in your house after about 3 months. Its much cheaper than a salt based system of thousands of dollars. But know that this system will need frequent filter changes. It won\\'t last a year, only maybe 6 months.

       " 'will this heating element work with a kenmore 110.66112500? According to Sears own \"searspartsdirect.com\" it IS actually the substitution for 8565582. So yes that should be the correct part. I replaced it once and didn\\'t replace the thermostats and a couple months later I had to replace it again. This time I replaced the thermostats hoping it will last longer. Easy repair though. Between buying on amazon and watching youtube you can fix anything now..

       " 'how to fill washer with just hot water no clothes? These high efficiency washers will not fill. They work by spraying water.. how do you load the washer with just hot water and then add clothes and detergent ? The machine won\\'t do this. It only adds water based on the weight of the clothes already loaded (and doesn\\'t add enough). The way I have gotten around this has been to detach the hot water hose from the machine and turn on the faucet and add it myself.. how do you reset washing machine after replacing the lid lock switch Sorry Terri I have never had to do that.. iS IT NORMAL TO MAKE LOUD NOISE AT BEGINNING? Do you mean \"at beginning\" of a cycle or when it is newly installed?

       " 'Average wash time for Whirlpool #WTW485OBW1 Depends on the load setting, but it is quite a bit slower than the older models that don\\'t sense the amount of clothing in the washer.. Is it quiet running? It is very loud. When it failed about a year after we bought it the repairman told us many people believe the machine is broken when it is making a normal amount of noise. Many problems with this unit, which I chose because it was the lowest cost model at Lowe\\'s.. Is the Whirlpool top loader washer WTW4800BQ0 a good machine? Hi Susan. After reading the other responses, I have to say that I do NOT agree with them. I have had this machine since May 2013. I have NEVER had any issues with it. I do 5 to 8 loads of laundry every weekend. Never had a breakdown, never had clothes \\'get holes in them\\', never had clothes \\'disappear\\'. I use the Regular Light, Casual Light, and Delicate cycles mostly. Handles a large loads like towels (8 large) just fine on the \\'super\\' water setting on the Normal Light cycle. Same goes for large loads of jeans (8 pairs) Takes just under an hour for the light cycles to finish, and less with the Delicate. The loads get cleaned well. The lid does lock, but only after the washer has finished filling and the cycle begins. Lid locks are now standard on ALL new washing machines per Federal safety law. I follow the manufacturers instructions and use the washer as it was intended using common sense that dictates to NEVER overload a clothes washer as to not cause undo stress on the machine or your laundry. Another thing to know is that this washer has a standard agitator in the middle of the basket. There is a similar model to this one that is a High Efficiency machine that does not have an agitator and that machine gets a lot of bad reviews as well. I have found that some comments for this machine are really pertaining to that other machine. To be fair, I have owned the washer for under a year, and there have been some comments that this machine starts having problems after a year\\'s time. So I\\'ll just have to see about that and cross that bridge IF I get to it. On a side note, I have the matching 7.0 Gas Dryer and it is a VERY GOOD dryer. Simple to use and dries our laundry effectively. I hope this answer helps you. Thank you. Does your washer sound like it is in a bind when it is washing? Yes it does. The sounds it makes is weird...very unlike my previous washer. It\\'s so upsetting that the new, \"improved\" version of washers actually suck!. does it come with a warranty I am not sure. I returned it. It stopped washing on the second wash load. it was the washer from hell.. does it have a matching dryer? Yes. I\\'m having problems with my washer eating my clothes! It\\'s really pissing me off. It doesn\\'t matter the size of the load either. ANNOYED! How about u? Face it, it is a piece of junk. Mine died after less than 2 years and my repairman said it wasn\\'t worth fixing. I went to a used appliance store and bought an old model that doesn\\'t lock the lid, you can let clothes soak, and it isn\\'t constantly refusing to spin---and the repairman will be able to fix it at a reasonable price. I love it!. Does this washer have a agitator Yes, but it\\'s way smaller than the older models. Now these so-called \"modern\" models have such small agitators that it does not clean your clothes very well -- not at all like the models of past. Terrible!!!!. What is the companion electric dryer for Whirlpool WTW4800XQ4? I don\\'t remember. I bought them as a set.. Is anyone else not having \"warm\" water? When I use the warm water setting only cold water comes out. I have watched it fill til the end, too. Even though I have serious questions about one or two of what seems to me idiotic design flaws on this machine I would say the engineer is dumb but not stupid. They wouldn\\'t be that stupid. Yes the warm water works fine. Even though the manual is too skimpy on explaining things, it appears to have a temperature sensor that adjusts the amounts of cold and hot that enters. Works great on mine.. ',\n",

I have adjusted the screw and still no luck. I am at the point of getting rid of it and buying a new one. Very disappointing, especially considering how expensive they are. Wish I could be more help. I\\'m looking to install this under a wooden bar. Can the taps be removed/moved to the top of the bar with just the tubing leaving the kegorator? Yes. Can this be used outdoors? I am not sure. But personally, if I had to do it all again, I wouldn\\'t buy this brand at all.. Can u fit a slim 1/4 and a 1/6 together? Negative. You can fit (1) 1/4 or (2) 1/6 slims. Temp You need to call and talk to them. They have instructions for fixing the thermostat and temperature. Chris. I friend of mine had a kegarator with Beer on one side and root beer on the other. Can I do that with this? Yes. It has been awesome for my boyfriend and I! You can do any two things you would like!. Just want to confirm this unit comes with all the tubing needed so all I need to do is get co2 gas and it is ready to go. It comes with everything. The tank that comes with it is awfully small and difficult to get filled. You can easily get a larger tank from your local gas dealer, and they usually have an exchange program too. It even comes with replacement gaskets (all of them). It takes a little time to get the pressure adjusted right, but after that, let the good times flow!. I know from the descriptions, the dimensions are 21.3 x 26.6 x 33.2 inches. Is 26.6\" from front to back? Yes.. Is the interior of the unit stainless steel ? I believe it is black plastic. Does this kegerator hold colors light or rubber kegs? The system is designed to handle American Sankey \"D\" kegs (https://www.kegs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_0370.jpg), but the tubing can be cut and fit to accomodate any style keg.. ',\n",

Honestly, we had issues with this particular unit on one of our recent installations. Look at some of the other smaller units as they are better fit to accommodate your 7\\' ceiling height.. Unit wobbles a bit...anyone have that problem? Our contractor installed with ceiling bracket, but it moves around a bit when pushing buttons. Yes a tad bit . its just the design. U can have the contractor but ceiling wood studs to brac it better instead of the drywall studs . also my fan now glitches so I got to look into that. It is a year old now. I\\'m pretty concerned about the 4 screws in the ceiling Sheetrock won\\'t hold the vent and it will come crashing down. Do those screws work? It will not hold if screwed into sheetrock only....I am sure that our ceiling beams and a purchased bracket for mounting were used to mount the vent. We had to use it as a recirculating unit, rather than vented to the outside. It was a big job to install and our electrician did most of the job. He special ordered the bracket but I couldnt give you more info. We have had the unit for 2 yrs and I amvery happy with it.. How many amps and what type of connection does this require? Can I hardwire it using romex or does it use a cord to be plugged into a receptacle? It comes wit a plug on it, so I put a receptacle in the attic next to the hole I cut for the vent to go through. The wire is long enough to go right through there & plug in easily.. Can I connect the venting pipe from the side or it has to come from the ceiling? from the ceiling.. Will this work fora 10\\' ceiling? If not, is there an extension kit? We doubt it, but honestly don\\'t know if it will work for a 10\\' ceiling and the extension kit is a question for the manufacturer.. We accidentally broke the glass while installing this. Can we get replacement glass? Same thing happened to me. I ordered new glass direct from ADKY. I have a 80 inch high ceiling, will this work. Yes it\\'ll work it\\'s designed to work for up to 8 foot ceiling. what is the minimum number ot inches from the ceiling that this unit can be adjusted to I would say at the highest adjustment 29 to 31 inches from ceiling to allow proper clearance for the slotted vents in the upper portion of the assembly.. just to confirm, i can use this model for a ventless/ductless island?

Yes, CLR also works very good.. Would this work on a rain water collection system? I have a 1\" connection from the downspout diverter to the barrel. No pump.

We use ours on our house on a 1\" line and it works xlnt. Put a valve on each side of it, because you\\'ll want to shut off the outlet line to flush it.

I\\'m looking for a lighter color with hold flecks throughout. Let me first say that I worked for 30 yrs at PPG paint in various departments matching colors. I have this RO tap within 10 in of a Moen oil rubbed bronze faucet. The Moen does have small aluminum flakes in the coating giving it the appearance of gold flakes. The two blend so well I thought the RO tap had gold flakes also. However it doesn\\'t. It appears to have very small particle size mica in the coating. On cars, the mica would give the coating a subtle sparkle versus aluminum which can be small particle size giving the subtle reflectiveness or the in your face large particle aluminum that sparkles not just that little shimmer. Taking into account the sparkle/shimmer effect of mica and aluminum flake it would easily be an industry match since untrained eyes cannot pick up the minute color differences. So I would say it doesn\\'t have a solid chocolate brown appearance and it is not an exact match to my Moen faucet. But unless you get up close with a light to reflect off of the coating, you\\'d consider it a good match. Aside from that, you cna always return it if the subtle differences bother you.. is this for cold water only? we have this for separate drinking water that goes though our reverse osmosis system. We are very pleased with it. I imagine one could use it for hot water if you had the desire.. Can you lock the button open so you don\\'t have to hold it down to fill a large pitcher or something? The handle on this faucet is not spring loaded so it does not have to be held to dispense.. I need to estimate the minimum hole size. What is the diameter of the threaded shaft? 1/2\".

I think I get the intended use of this, but I just want to make sure... Can this be used as a pre filter between my well and well pump? Yes, it could, but I don\\'t think it is recommended to put a filter on the suction side if your pump.. My well water contains silt that clogs my washing machine. Which filter should I use on the washing machine cold water inlet line? This requires a multifaceted answer. First of all, how large is the sediment your well draws in? These filters are available in several different screen or mesh filter sizes. If it is sandy, you need to compare the size of the sand to the micron size of the filter element. I\\'d say this is the most important research that you need to do. Next I\\'d ask how much sand gets drawn in say daily, then over the course of a week. Thus could be determined by how much sand is in your toilet tanks, (when you take the lid off and look inside); then how often do you clean the screens on the washer? Lastly, do you see sand in the faucet arreaters? If the answer is a great deal to any of the above questions, I would advise you to get a filter which is one pipe size larger then then waterline coming from your pressure pump/ inlet to your house. This will allow a longer time between flushing intervals of the filter. I have used them in this application in the past, with great results for our customers. If it is installed correctly, the drain on the bottom would be run to the outside,or a nearby drain. Be sure to install a union on the drain line to allow for occasional disassembly. When the filter shows signs of being clogged- sediment in the bottom, color in the screen; then you flush it out for 1-2 minutes, until clear. I hope this helps you.

It isn\\'t necessary as far as i know. But, it really works and it is nice opening the refrigerator to no smells. When I changed mine, I smelled the old filter, to see if it really worked. The filter did smell like an old refrigerator. So, I always change my filters.. Can someone please provide me with the exact dimentions, height, width? Yes. Does this filter fit a whirlpool side by side model #W10325109?? W10325109 is the model number of the replacement water filter for a whirlpool fridge, not the model number of the fridge itself. If you can write back with your fridge model number and if you want the air or water filter I will try to confirm the correct products for you. If you are looking for a water filter, take the old one out and google the model number. The air filter likely won\\'t have any model number on it.. Is this Filter W10311524 compatible to W10335147A? I have a side by side Whirpool P/N 106.51133210 No it is different than W10335147A. Can one buy just the carbon paper that goes in the filter? No. whirlpool conquest refrigerator GS6SHEXNS air filter location....i cant find where it goes On my Whirlpool refrigerator, at the back of the top shelf (in the center) is a panel \"FreshFlow Air Filter\" that you remove to place this filter into.. where is this filter located Look inside the left vegetable draw. There is a white 3 inch plastic on the inside side. Gently lift it up and look on the back side and snap off the filter. See the little clips on the side of it. Press them in. It pops out very easily. . We put the old one in the dish washer. We will see if that works. The important filter is the water filter. Look at the right side at the top. Pull open from the bottom the door. You will see the other filter and pull it out when you order another one. Amazon is the best. Very reasonable prices. Pull other one out and insert new one. Good Luck Toni. Do you change the whirlpool fresh filter when tab is completedly red? I suppose you do but, my tab does not stay in the holder. I usually change it around 3-4 months.. I have a Kenmore Elite side by side made by Whirlpool. The part number for the Kenmore is: W10335147A - Does anyone know if this is the same filter? I have a Kenmore Elite as well, it is a 35 sq ft. side by side Refrigerator Freezer. I found on Amazon that the W10311524 has precisely the same demensions as the W103335147A. I therefore purchased three of the W10311524 on ebay postpaid for around $19.00. When they arrived I opened one and found it to be precisely the same right down to the number of pleats in the filter. It fit perfectly and even came with an identical triangular filter status indicator like the W10335147A that SEARS sells postpaid for $12.50 each. It appears that Whirpool now builds refrigerators for Frigidare, Kenmore and Kitchenade as well, and probably has different part numbers on this filter for each brand! I am now looking for a sheet of the filter material containing the activated carbon. If I can find it it should be an easy matter to cut the filter material with a paper cutter and then fan fold it. The white plastic case can be easily taken apart and washed, the new fanfolded filter inserted, and then the rebuilt filter easily installed for a cost of $0.25 a change or less. Off course one would not have a valid indicator gauge, but adding a reminder to change filters every six months on one\\'s smart phone could easily fix that! Finally, I would not run any of these refrigeratoirs with a filter very long. The filter has two purposes the first to keep dust and debrie from accumulating on the internal condensing coils and secondly to eliminate refigerator oders using the activated charcoal. These new refrigerators have a closed system so that one no longer have to brush and vacuum these coils. This especially nice for us as our siamese cat\\'s favorite spot is just to the left of our refrigerator.. Does the filter come with the filter status indicator Yes it\\'s included. ',\n",
       " 'is this compatible with the samsung 9100 series washer? As far as i know this will work on any front load stackable washer/dryer made by samsung. Easy to install!!. Will this stacking kit scratch my Washer? I would like to use this but I want to have the option to go back to a single if needed. Thanks No. Samsung 9100 series are specified 42.6\" high each. Will kit add to overall stacked height (i.e. &gt; 85.2\") since I have limited ceiling clearance? The existing plastic dryer feet come off and little rubber feet (1/2\") are added when stacked. Net is about the same. does this keep stop the vibration when load is off balance? we have unit stacked but not sure if plumber used a kit. thanks It does not stop it completely but it does reduce it. I had mine stacked without it and there is much less vibration.. Does someone know if this would stack ANY combination of samsung washers and dryers? I used the brackets to stack a new samsung washer and an old whirlpool dryer. Much cutting, rebuilding required. Worked fine.. I haven\\'t received my order yet but I want to know if I have to install anything on before lifting the dryer or after. Thanks in advance! The two long plastic pieces will fit on the bottom left and right side of the dryer to help the dryer rest on the washer. These must be put on before the dryer was stacked. Not sure I\\'d anyone else felt th is way but those long plastic pieces fit funny on the dryer and did not snap into place very easy. I actually thought for a minute I bought the wrong stacking kit. In addition there is an anchoring kit that screws into the back of each unit. This can be done once the pair is stacked.. ',\n",

Yes, I have a variety of baskets for my dishwasher, also, but this basket will fit in both the top and bottom racks. I love the other accesories that came with this bundle.

Yes, full 1 year warranty.. is this big enough for a queen sized comforter? never tried i always a large commercial machine at the laundry mat for that. is this big enough for a queen sized comforter? We have not tried yet but expect to do so. Our best guess is that it will. Worst case scenerio, we then take it to the laundromat.. Is this dual voltage ? Can it support 240 voltage? No. what is the matching dryer to this washer? I believe it's t the Maytag Maxima HE Steam Dryer. We do not have the dryer because we found out after buying the washer that the dryer had poor reviews. Most people complained that it did not dry the clothes very well.. What about installation? Will they install it on delivery? Carriers drop ship to site only. They do not go inside or install.. \",\n",

You sure can.I place them directly in the bucket with rice.This is a great product and good place to get them.. I have 5 gal buckets. What size Oxygen absorber do I need? Shelly,I use 6 gallon buckets but no real difference.I use 3 single packs per bucket for my white rice,wheat,pancake mix etc.I also use Gamma seal lids,they have a seal on the bucket side and the center section is threaded on and has a seal.Hope that helps and the seller was excellent.Oh,and have several buckets ready because once opened they start working.Prepping is smart.. can I just throw them in trash can that has a mix of boxed and sealed foods? maybe , But it has to be airtight. How does the oxygen indicator work? Is pink good or is pink bad? Pink is suppose to be good however mine were the opposite of good. When you ask about this you may get an answer like this----even though the color is pink, if you store them for more then 6 months we can not guarantee they will work. WHAT,,,,I used them right away but I know company's that come up with that sort of answer only needs never to get my business again.. Are they made in the USA? My package is made by Oaktea. There is no label as to where it is made. It does suggest to e-mail sales@oaktea.com.. How can I tell they are working It's not going to work on refrigerated stuff, so put them in rice, beans, oat meal and so on. You'll be able to tell just by the freshness over time and if there is nothing crawling around in whatever; they're working.. How many would I have to put into a 1 gallon bag? If you vacuum out most of the air in the bag(I just use the vacuum cleaner) One (1) 100 cc would be sufficient. One (1) 300 cc is an insurance factor. A 2000cc absorber is for 5 gal bags.. \",\n",

Does this kill hantavirus and can it be used in a fogger? I don't know about hantavirus isn't that transmitted by rodent droppings? Anyway my understanding is that this is not for viruses it's for mold. I would never ever put it in a fogger as the fumes are strong and there are all kinds of warnings on the label about them. You even need to wear gloves when using it to protect your skin from contact. This is serious strong stuff I would not mess around with using it any other way than as they say on the label..

How long does the smell last after application? Did this cause any allergic reactions to users who have allergies and asthma? It can last up to a few days, but dies down. It's very potent when using it, definitely need to wear a mask. It can irritate sinus and lungs if you don't wear appropriate protection. If customers have allergies and/or asthma it more than likely will bother them. However, it is a great product and gets the job done.. do I need to dilute the solution before spraying ? No it should be applied without dilution. I used a sponge to apply, but I think it should be ok spraying. It is a little more viscous than water.. Can you use this on old records, some going back to late 1800's, to get rid of mold? Will the stains or mold spots disappear or is it more of a neutra Try it on a test piece first.

Dear Denise, the best place to go to the REPAIR CLINIC.COM they can cross reference your G.E. oven , with the information you gave me and they will give you the correct igniter for your oven one thing to remember with igniters , is that some light up only half what there suppose to and therefore will not turn on the main gas you can check that with an amp. meter,igniters will usually have a rating on it such as 500w or so. so your amp probe will show about 5 amps. which means perfect any less then that its defective, also make sure first that you have power going to the igniter. \",\n",

       " \"I have a GE Profile side by side refrigerator model PSS26MSRSS. The water dispenser just trickles water. It also makes a little noise while it dispenses water. I tried defrosting water line. That is not the answer. The Ice maker &amp; dispensor works fine.... Several possible causes of problems with water to dispenser. Troubleshooting tips: 1. Check to see if the ice maker is still working. If so, the problem is probably not caused by a water filter problem since the water to the ice maker has to go through the filter also. 2. Disconnect water tubing connector at bottom of refrigerator where it enters the freezer door. Then press water dispenser switch. If water comes out of the disconnected line then the problem is probably a frozen water line in the freezer door. Reconnect the line and defrost the freezer. If the problem occurs again there are other measures that can be taken to prevent freezing. 3. Turn off power, remove cover and valve bracket on the back of the unit, and pull the valve assembly out where you can get to it. There are two valves. The first valve is the inlet valve and must open whenever the ice maker or the water dispenser operates. The second valve has two separate outlets - one for the ice maker and one for the freezer. There is a short tubing from the outlet of the first valve to the inlet of the second valve. Disconnect this tubing by pressing in on the connector while pulling out on the tube. Direct the open end of the tube toward a pan. Then keeping clear of all electrical wires, plug the refrigerator back in. Press the water dispenser. If water does not come out of the inlet valve, the valve is probably bad. If it does come out, it is probably the second valve. You can run a similar test on the second valve if the first valve proves to be okay. 4. If you are comfortable with your do-it-yourself skills, you can also use a voltmeter to confirm that the valve is receiving 110 volts when the water dispenser is depressed. I even went so far as to jumper the water dispenser connector to the ice maker side of the valve to confirm that that side would open when I depressed the water dispenser. Be careful if you try these because you are working with 110 volt power. If the valve is not getting 110v power when the dispenser is depressed, it is probably due to either a bad controller board or a bad electrical connection.. Will this fit a PSS26SGRESS side by side GE? Thanks Couldn't say for sure, but I think it would.. Will this work on a GE GSH25JSTA SS?

I determined the coil is open (Ohmed open). My part# is RIV-12AE2 for a model GSS25QGTABB side by side fridge. Is this the correct replacement part? When I googled your part # RIV-12AE2, it brought up links to sites showing a part that looked like the one I bought from Amazon that is the solenoid valve for the water dispenser and ice maker that I replaced in my GE side by side a few weeks ago. The valve was located at the bottom left of the back of the refrigerator. I shut off the water supply at the wall, unplugged the refrigerator and then unscrewed and took off the lower rear cover panel and disconnected the main water line running into the solenoid valve. I disconnected the valve and then pulled off the two lines running to the ice maker and water dispenser, and simply reconnected all three lines (the main water line from the wall) and the two lines up to the ice maker and dispenser, and then I re-hooked the valve into the fridge, plugged in the fridge, turned on the water, and then checked the dispenser. No more dripping water. I hope this helps you.. GE refrigeratormakes ice cubes, but will not dispense them?

       " 'Hi I need this part for a GE fridge in Venezuela (model GST201BMBW). Is this part the right one? I cannot be exactly sure without examining your fridge, but it was the part that corrected our problem. When we turned our fridge on the temperature would come down, but never get as cold as it should. The problem was intermittent and hard to diagnose. We used an appliance website to help us \"trouble shoot\" the issue, tried various parts and eventually this worked. We ordered from Amazon because the price was cheaper. If you order this, just make sure whether you need the little white corded thermistor (as pictured) for your model or not. They make one that comes without it also. Hope this helps!. Does it comes in original GE Box? The fan comes in a box from Sealed Unit Parts Company, Inc (Supco). I will say that everything was exactly the same as the unit that it replaced so I don\\'t know if this company supplies this part to GE or not. I will also say that for the model of my refrigerator, GE typically identified the replacement part as the fan and connector only without the thermostat or the blue grommet. I did not want to get into the more extensive work related to cutting of the grommet so it could be reused and moving the thermostat connections to the new fan so I continued my research and came across this on Amazon. A little more research and I was able to identify this was the exact replacement I needed. Ordering this part from Amazon was actually cheaper than what the local appliance parts house wanted to charge for the fan by itself so I\\'m very pleased with the purchase.. I wonder if this part works also in frezeer. I bought another with the exact series of numbers (WR60X10185), but came without the sensor. The WR60X10185 comes W/O the sensor is for the freezer.

       " \"does it read in celsius?? does it read in celsius?? Yes, the unit does read in degrees Celsius. There is a switch on the back of the master unit and a switch on the inside of the remote units to change from F to C and back to F..

Yes, it does give a reading from the remote sensor and also a reading from the receiver itself.. Does unit automatically display all three remote zones? What is the battery life? How often is humidity read? I can speak to the battery life. I installed the base unit and one remote (outside) on 2012 Dec 2. I'd ordered lithium batteries for it (good for temperature extremes), but they hadn't arrived yet, so I loaded them up with some AA Duracell alkaline batteries I had. 472 days later, the main unit started losing contact with the remote, and I noticed its low battery indicator was on. The remote was still going strong. I replaced the alkaline batteries in both units with the lithium batteries that I'd ordered back in 2012. That works out to 15 months (over two winters and one summer) on just regular alkaline batteries. I'm expecting longer life from the lithiums.. How many feet from the humidifier does the sensor read? Meade says 100 feet. I've never had mine more than 25 feet apart. Never a problem at that distance. I'm sure as long as there is a window between the two, it would be fine at 100 feet.. Can it be set to show outside temp. always on display? Yes, You can choose indoors or out. It also has other channels if you want to set up more transmitters (not included) to monitor temps and humidity in other locations. It also has temp and humidity memory that records highs and lows.. If you push the channel button to display say channel #1 which is out doors will the display remain showing the outdoor channel #1 temperature as long I don't push the channel button again? Once you view any channel, that view will continue UNTIL you push the channel button again, causing the display to view each sensor in its order (1, 2, 3 and inside temp). It is very accurate and easy to use.. How accurate is the humidity sensor? (i.e. +/- what % humidity is this accurate to?) It seems to be very accurate. The manufacturers specs would tell u exactly how accurate. Very happy with the unit. Got a new wireless phone system and had to move the Meade away from it because it wasn't working properly when to close to the new phones. Took awhile to figure that out.. Is this made in the US? The Company is located in Irvine, CA. They are most known for making telescopes. They are a global company. I would assume that this weather station is made overseas but not sure. Walmart lists some of there products as imported. Either way, it works. I guess the company is 50/50 Us and China?. Can it be mounted on a wall? yes. can you put the sensor in the crawl space under the house and it work? Yes. I couldn't see why you couldn't.

       " 'is there a way to tap both keg at once for use No. can this be used to force carbonate beer? It would force carbonate a keg, but you would need to use the paintball tank option and it would probably take a couple weeks. If you used the 16 gram co2 cartridges, it would take several of them to carbonate one keg. I have always used priming sugar and let the kegs carbonate naturally and then used the party pub to dispense and maintain carbonation.. Will this fit a 2.5 gallon corny keg (about 15\" high, 8\" diameter)? About 16 inches of height is usable. It will fit but maybe snug.. From what I am reading it seems that if I use a Heineken style keg that has been precharged with CO2 then I do not need a CO2 cartridge/tank. Correct? That is correct. You just attached the supplied Heineken adapter to the beer line, then press it into place on top of the mini keg.. Do I need to buy a CO2 tank or does the product come with one? How often does it need to be filled? You have to buy these as a separate purchase. They don\\'t last long, maybe a keg or so. You should buy several at a time.. What beers can fit this dispenser? All 5 liter kegs? Yes, 5 L kegs, not to be confused with 5 gallon kegs. I\\'ve found that they are harder to find, but available if you have a good liquor store. Breckenridge Brewery always releases their season beer in this size, and my store usually imports a couple from Germany. But you can use it with the Heineken and New Castle one that are available every where. If you buy empty kegs some craft brewers will fill them for you.. What is the average temp range? Meaning, does it keep the beer really cold? Mine is currently sitting at 40 Fahrenheit/5 Celsius, and it maintains that easily. It can go lower, but I leave it on that.. is this a thermoelectric cooler or does it use a freon compressor unit like a standard refrigerator? This is not a thermoelectric cooler. It has a compressor just like a refrigerator. It\\'s not the quietest unit, but the entire inside compartment is cooled including the hoses. This unit is way better than the thermoelectric models. I highly recommend this unit!. can you screw off the black tap handle and put on a different one? It turns slightly but I don\\'t think it will come off.. ',\n",
       " \"I have a Keurig B79 Single (K) cup. Will these filters fit my machine? Hi! If your B79 came with a removable water filter device in the water tank (it should have) these charcoal filters will fit just fine.. how do you replace the filter? Follow directions in your book. Every Keurig is not the same. On my Keurig - the water filter is in the water reservoir. There is a removable plastic piece and you take the old filter out and put a new one in. you have to soak it for 20 min. in water first then run under the spigot for 60 seconds. Hope this was a help.. Do they work with the k-45 Keurig brewer? yes as long as you have the insert to go into the water area, I use them all the time, it helps with not having to clean your machine as much. You can rotate the date so you know when to insert another filter.. how long does one filter last before it has to be replaced? The filter should be replaced every 1-2 months, depending upon usage. I set my dial for 2 months ahead as we brew only about 3-4 cups per day.. Will it fit my Keurig coffe maker? Yes. It fits fine. I am sure that the charcoal filters will fit in any Keurig coffee maker. Slipped right in to the spot the original one was.. will it fit elite b40? YES they will fit. Below is from the Keurig web site About This Product: This Water Filter Cartridge Refill pack includes six replacement filters for your Keurig Water Filter Starter Kit accessory (sold separately). Simply place a cartridge into the Water Filter Assembly and insert into your water reservoir. For best results, replace your water filter cartridge every 2 months or 60 tank refills. For use exclusively with Keurig Single Cup Reservoir Brewing Systems purchased after August 2007. This is not compatible with the Mini Brewing System, Mini Plus Brewing System, the B145 OfficePRO Brewing System, or the Rivo System.. Will this work in the Keurig Vue V1255? I don't own that model but if your coffee maker was made after 2007 the description states it will fit.. These are knockoffs don't buy? Yeah, they're knockoffs. So what? They work fine, and they're a lot cheaper than the brand name ones. If they're the same filter, why would you want to spend the money on the brand panel? Been using these for about two years. They're great!. Are the filters genuine Keurig water filters? Mine came in very authentic-looking Keurig package. The Keurig website sells a 6-pack of water filters but doesn't show an image of the package (just 6 unboxed filters lined up).. Will these work in the Kuerig single cup maker? Yes. \",\n",

They are only open M-F 9 - 5:30 Pacific time. It does seem to me that when I received my package, there was a number on the box that may have been different that also reached them. They were very helpful. However, the clock does run extremely fast and is never right, FYI. can you confirm maximum width, as it must fit in 30\" space. thanks yes. You will have about 1/4\" so measure carefully! The vent stack was particularly hard to install. Might consider getting a couple of stainless self tapping screws.

       " 'I cook Thai-foods on gas stove, will this hood be the right one for me? This hood has worked pretty well when I used it in the context of Indian food.

My Broan only has a rectangle vent at back of rang hood, does this one fit my wall vent? Or do I need extra dry wall work to fit the round hose pipe The AKDY has a round vent at the top of the unit, so you\\'ll have to cover the existing hole and make a new opening.

Is this model compatible with samsung RS21HDUSW1 ? i matched the model # on the amazon description with the owners manual. the model # inside the door did not match.. We put in a filterAce+ filter on our Samsung French door RF266AEWP model. Now we cannot remove it. We bought it in Jan.2012. Now what? Samsung will not cover damage incurred by using generic filters. I have found it difficult to remove the filter (even the Samsung filters). My filter is in the back right corner of the refrigerator, with a wine shelf in the way. I use a 'rubber husband' gripper to firmly hold the filter to turn it. Also, make sure you are turning it counter clockwise. As there is pressure in the water line, that also causes some resistance. I have never needed to do so, but you could shut off the water line to the refrigerator, drain some water from the water dispenser and see if that helps. Otherwise call Hulk Hogan to try to turn it.. Does this filter work in a Samsung model rf268abwp refrigerator? I Googled the model # of the refrigerator you provided to find the # of the water filter you would need. It appears this filter would work. However, to be sure, you may want to remove the filter presently in your refrigerator and match its' model number with what Filter Ace+ advertises it can replace. If you don't want to remove the filter, you can either refer to the manual that came with the refrigerator or give Samsung a call directly. They can provide you with the model number of the filter you need. Then just match that number to the replacement filter. Hope this helps!. I too had a problem with a non-EOM filter not locking. Will this one work with my RFG297AARS? No. I have had conflicting reports - one says it works with the French Door Samsung Model RFG238AAES/AA and another says it won't.Who is right?

       " 'Can the ovens be used without convection? in other words, can the convectioin feature be left off? Well the top smaller oven is not convection at all. You can use the bottom oven with or without convection also. Hey Owners, what does \"Power Outage Compatible\" mean? Range top works without A/C? I hope..I have no idea is not an answer. :-) Cooktop does not work without ac power. Igniters and fuel lockoff require it to operate. Does this range require a 220v outlet? (Like the kind a clothes dryer requires?) my electrician had to install a special outlet for the stove so I think yes. Do either of the ovens have a broiler? both ovens have broil function only bottom oven has convection though. what do I need to install the KitchenAid Architect Series II KDRS505XSS 30 Freestanding Dual-Fuel Double Oven Range, when it arrives??? You will ne 30 inch wide counter space, You will also require a dual fuel line. I would check with your contractor prior to purchasing. Does the oven come with a propane conversion kit? Yes it has a regulator on the back for propane or ng but I would call kitchen aid to make sure nothing else isnt needed. Are both ovens electric? why is there a 12000 BTU Broiler burner specified? Both ovens are electric. You have a fifth burner in the center of the stove top for a grilling Pam that comes with this!. Does this range include the necessary 220 power chord? If not will you give me the name or number of the connector. Yes it does have a 220 cord.. can you cook a turkey in any of these ovens. Yes the bottom oven works well for a turkey, the top oven would be too short.. If the power is down/off at your home, can you still use the burners by lighting them with a match? Hi Joe--Naw, it doesn\\'t appear that you can. It is possible to light the burners with a match if the electronic igniters were to fail, but the range must still be receiving power. When I trip the circuit breaker at the fuse box and try to light the burners by hand, I can\\'t. There must be some kind of annoying \"safety\" feature that shuts off the gas to the burners if the unit loses electrical power--Chris. ',\n",
       " 'i thought it also controled the fan opperations ? This Device allows control of heat, cool, off or hold settings or switch temperature readings at the device or thermostat or of course set the temperature desired. It also displays the out door temperature as I have it set up. Depending on the system I understand it may have more capabilities but I do not see any fan controls available on the device.. Hi, does this come with a Base thermostat and a portable one? Meaning, does it come with one that goes where the one I have now is,and a portable one? No. This comes with a base station that u wire in where your old thermostat was and a thermostat that can be mounted on a wall in another room which saves you from running all new wires to a new desired location, but u can order a remote thermostat with it that sits on a dresser which is called the Honeywell REM5000R1001 portable comfort control. I purchased this too on amazon for around $90. Works great.... Can you use more than one remote for two zones no only one remote per system. What is minimal Redlink thermostat system I can use to control the temperature of the room I am in with the Portable Comfort Control? In my house each floor/zone has a wireless thermostate (3 total), an RF wireless receiver on zone control and this remote thermostat to control all zones. To control the floor I am on I can either walk to wireless thermostat screwed into the wall and adjust it or use the wireless portable to control any zone. I installed 2 years ago to eliminate walking up and down stairs to adjust zones.. How can I tell if the wiring for my existing thermostat is compatible with this system? If you search for the wiring instructions for the Honeywell RedLINK system (example: Honeywell document 69-2091EFS), you can see the required wiring hookups. This should allow you to assess compatibility. If you are already using a modern (digital) thermostat, you should be able to install the RedLINK system without too much trouble. However, keep in mind that this system is intended to mount on or near the existing HVAC system, not at the location of the thermostat. So having access to your utility closet will be helpful.. If I do not have a \"hold\" set on the remote, but I select \"read temp from this device\", will the main thermostat use the remote temp when following a schedule? Yes. \\'read temp from this device\\' does exactly what it says, regardless of whether it\\'s on hold or not.. I have the Portable Comfort Control but I stepped on it. If I replace it with a new one, is it easy to set up? Yes - I was expecting to have trouble, but followed the instructions that come with the new one - which involves pointing the control at the wireless \"box\" that - in our case is mounted on the wall in our air handler cupboard.. Is professional setup or installation required? I already have an installed Redlink thermostat. I had a Lennox heatpump added to my gas furnace this spring. Reading through the new thermostat manual I found this item as an accessory and since I\\'m downstairs and renters are upstairs I thought it would be useful. I ordered through Amazon and the setup was a breeze. After installing the batteries it wants to search for a signal from the furnace/heat pump. On the furnace there was a new control box of electronics, You remove the cover and there is a button you press, which sends out the signal to the remote......you can watch it happen on the screen.......poof it\\'s links up and not a problem since. Simple instructions to follow came with the unit. Now I can observe and control from downstairs what the upstairs thermostat is doing........it\\'s been great.. Does this Portable Comfort Control come with the base unit? If not, then what do I need to have to controller communicate with to start the furnace? This unit works in conjunction with a Comfortnet Thermostat. The thermostat only works with furnaces, heat pumps and condensers that are sold with Comfornet Communicating Interfaces integrated into the unit. The entire system must be manufactured with Comfortnet integrated by the manufacturer for it to all work. All the devices can communicate with all the other devices to maximize operation and provide diagnostic information to the user through the thermostats display.. This device doesn\\'t work as a remote, wireless temp sensor, right? It just lets you change the thermostat setting remotely? No sir.. It does work as a wireless temp sensor. I purchased because my thermostats are located in a weird place in the house. I wanted to be able to move the temp sensor around without moving the stat. For example, our bedroom stat is in the hallway. With this unit, I am able to read and adjust the bedroom temp. You can set it up to use the stat for the temp sensor or the remote temp sensor. Honestly, I love mine. I actually have 2 now and helped to eliminate moving the stat and fixed the hot/cold spots where we generally are in the house. Easy to set up and works great. My stats are Honeywell VisionPro 8000.. ',\n",

       " 'With the faucet do you just turn on the hot water? When it\\'s done, do you immediately have to turn the faucet off? Where do Cascade packs go? The dishwasher will heat the water on its own, so you can turn on hot, cold, or both. It also controls the water flow. Having the sink on doesn\\'t make any water run. The dishwasher will turn the water off and on as the cycle runs. So you don\\'t need to worry about turning it off right away. It will have the water stopped when it\\'s done. Just make sure you turn the faucet off and hit the de-pressurize button before you unhook the hose from the sink. I\\'ve never used cascade packs, but now you have me wondering if that it what the tiny hanging basket is for.. I notice that there is no information on the drain hose. Is it connected to the sink drain below the sink, or does it just lay in the sink to drain? The drain hose is actually one piece together with the quick connect faucet adapter. It is a one piece that snaps onto your kitchen faucet. You turn on your hot water and when necessary, it will fill the tub. Once it is time to drain the tub, it will empty directly into your sink. (this way, you don\\'t have to worry about a single loose hose that may fall out of the sink and onto your floor.) It also has a bypass button on the connector to let you obtain water from the faucet while connected. Hope this helps!. What is the DEPTH outside is 17x20x21.5 (HxDxW) inside is 12.5x17.5x20 (HxDxW) there\\'s a lip on the outside where the hose runs along so it doesn\\'t push away any further than the 20\", sometimes with bigger plates like larger dinner plates and some large cookware its a little harder to fit straight but with a little angling I haven\\'t found anything that hasn\\'t fit. In case something goes wrong, has anyone returned this heavy unit to Amazon? Do you have to pay shipping? I have never returned this particular item to Amazon, but I have returned other large, heavy, and bulky items. If the item is defective or arrives damaged, Amazon always has paid the shipping for me.. I would have to install this on a shelf thats lower than my sink, would the pump be able to pump the water up into the sink? I have mine on a rolling cart that is much lower then my sink and I have no problems other then the hoses don\\'t totally empty out and will spill water on floor when I unhook if I don\\'t keep the up. Has anyone experienced a leak? Teflon tape on the faucet adapter works great, but my countertop still has puddles of water after use. Any thoughts? I had puddles once. I hand-tightened the hose connections on the back and haven\\'t had an issue since. I\\'ve had the dishwasher for 1 1/2 years and LOVE it!. What is the exact measurement of the hose, from attachment to attachment? Thank you! Using a tape measure and stretching the hose out, it came out to about 55\" or 4 ft 7\". I thought I read somewhere that the hoses were 5ft long, and some of the difference may be the bends in the hoses and the inability to stretch them out completely straight. If you figure putting your dishwasher within 4 to 4 1/2 ft of your sink hookup, you will probably have no difficulty.. I don\\'t have much space on the countertop (tiny kitchen), but can free space under the sink. Has anyone tried to put it that low? Will it drain? I do not have one yet, but on other sites I have read that people have put it under their sinks and had it connected to the plumbing under there and it worked great. They all had plumbers do that for them. I\\'m planning to get a rolling cart to put mine on, so I can roll it up to the sink when using then put it in the closet when not.. Actual size: Does anyone know which is correct? SPT is Suppentown. The company or Amazon should alert customers to that. Some SPT products sold through Amazon are listed as Suppentown SPT. Unit dimension (W x D x H) 21.65 x 19.69 x 17.24 in (copied from website) Package dimension 21.85 x 21.21 x 20.39 in I\\'m late to the game but hope this serves as an FYI for others.. How many gallons of water is used during a cycle? I am off a well and it doesn\\'t have a great amount of water in it (we run out every few weeks). One section of my sink is about 13\"x15\". With a drain plug, the normal cycle fills it about half way. It is MUCH less water than washing the same dishes by hand. Also they come cleaner.. ',\n",
       " 'Can this be perma-installed? I don\\'t mind having the lines run, just need a smaller unit - no space for a built in.. but don\\'t want to hook up faucet Yes. I tried to have that done and it would not have been good in my case as I was moving sone. But the handyman said it could be semi built in. It is an awesome dishwasher and I would purchase again.. Just received it but my faucet is a regular one with no threads. Any suggestions on what I should do? I\\'m not sure if I completely understand your issue, but I do know that I had an unconventional faucet and this youtube video solved all my problems! All it required was a pair of pliers. In fact, I didn\\'t actually have to buy the part she buys in the video, so pull yours out and see if you need to buy one before you go out and spend the money. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYG12CoNQW8 If this isn\\'t what\\'s going on with yours let me know and I\\'ll see what I can do to help.. just opened the spt dishwasher: What does that mean????? They fold up, actually, and snap into place. I almost never use mine, and use that space for frying pans and smaller pots.. What happens if the faucet is left running after the wash is complete? Do you need to be near the unit to promptly shut off the water after a wash? I have left the faucet on in the past but try not to. I know how damage a burst hose could cause. My suggestion is to not leave the supply hose pressurised (faucet on) whenever possible.. what are the real dimentions? HxWxD?? 17-1/8 H x 21-1/2 W x 19-5/8 deep, plus 2\" (so 21-5/8\") when the hose is connected to the back. Do you wait next to it and turn off the water as soon as it\\'s done washing? Or does it fill and then you turn off the faucet &amp; it begins washing? You\\'ll get an instruction manual. It comes with an attachment for your faucet so it can couple with the water\\'s input/output. I preheat the water after connecting to faucet, turn on hot water and use red button (release valve) until it\\'s coming out hot. Then choose your cycle and push start. There is a 10 second delay before it starts. You leave the water on until it beeps several times, telling you it\\'s finished. You turn off dishwasher, turn off water, push the red release button on coupler (releases any water pressure) then you uncouple and then I pull the hose upward from the back to drain water still in hose. Certain cycles heat the water so you\\'ll want to pull open the door and let the steam out and the dishes (hot) will finish drying. The manual is not written well, but it\\'s not rocket science, so you\\'ll figure it out. But you leave hot on until it finishes the cycle (also, the red light that flashes while running, goes solid red when cycle is over). It has a lot of options, so you\\'ll want to read it carefully. But it\\'s a good dishwasher. Which reminds me... I\\'d better load mine up... again :). Does the SPT Portable Countertop Dishwasher require a sink with a garbage disposal? No.. How long is the hose? My counter on the sink side is too narrow, I may need to use the counter across my small galley style kitchen. Its actually quite long. Most of my hose is coiled in the sink as my dishwasher is right next to the sink. The outlets for the hose is on the RIGHT side of the unit, so if you will be needing to put the dishwasher on the right side of the sink, the hoses will run behind the unit and you\\'ll lose a good bit of length.. Are there any limitations as to what dishwasher detergent etc we can use? Yes and no... You can use any powder or liquid/gel dishwasher detergent you would like however if you choose to use the popular tablets, packs,pods, the owners manual says that you should use the longest cycle on the dishwasher so that the detergent us fully dissolved and properly rinsed away. I have never used the packs in my machine but understand the longer cycle, since the regular cycle uses only a little more than three gallons of water for the entire cycle. Hope this is helpful.... How much water does the unit use in a cycle? How many Gallons? I don\\'t recall the exact amount but it is very low water use. Far less than if I washed by hand. As I recall the normal cycle only uses about 3 gallons for the entire cycle.. ',\n",

       " 'Does this unit have a spin cycle if using as a washer? Or do you have to buy a separate spin dryer to remove the water from your clothes? No, this washer does not have a spin dry function. Also, as a clothing washer I would highly recommend the Panda or Basecamp washers over this model. None of them have spin dry, so you will need a separate spinner. The small blue spinner works well. It operates at 1,600 RPM. This is quite a bit faster than a typical washing machines spin cycle. Those are normally about 600 RPM. The larger stainless steel drum spinner operates at 3,200 RPM and leaves your clothes dry enough to wear in a pinch. They will hang dry in only about an hour out of the faster machine. Buy whichever one suits your needs. Be aware that capacity wise the 3,200 RPM model more closely matches that of the Panda / Basecamp washer. Hope this helps!. is this washer for cloth? or just extracting some kind of herb or something like that? is it okay to wash my baby\\'s cloth? This machine, by design is a clothes washer, popular in Asia and many other (non USA) countries around the world. In this particular instance this one is re-branded and being sold with a 220 micron pouch for use as an extraction machine to make \"bubble hash\" out of marijuana. You can of course use it safely to wash your baby clothes. However, I would recommend the Panda or Basecamp washing machines over this model. This one has been marked up in price for no real reason, and the mesh bag will be of no use to you. It is not tough enough for clothing use. The Panda and basecamp machines are less expensive, and better models when it comes to reliability and motor power for clothes. This model is only about $30 USD in China! (Talk about killer profit here!) Anyway, I hope this helps you! Oh and on another note, none of these machines have a spin dry function. You will want to pick up the small blue spinner (1,600 ROM)for lighter things like the baby clothes, or the bigger 3,200 RPM for when you need things almost completely dry out of the spinner, or larger things spun. The larger spinner is much more expensive, and even the smaller one drys things much more than a typical washing machine spin cycle.. does it extract water from wet clothes no forced extraction but a drain hose and gravity.. does it have to be hooked up to a faucet or do you just add water with a bucket also does it spin out the water It comes with a cheesy faucet connector, easier to fill with a bucket or pitcher. Does not spin water out but does have a small drain hose on outside of machine. This machine is not for washing clothes, it is for making bubble hash extract. I suppose you could wash socks and underwear in it.. What kind of plastic is the machine made out of? It is made almost all out of plastic. It is flimsy and jamns and stops. Through it away after a month. Drill with paddles and bubble bags is way to go. Best machine I use for maximum keif/hash is from a dude that made 160 and 220 micron drums. They are placed in lined box. Put tumbler/drum in a small freezer for 24 hours full of cruddy bud/shake. Turn on small motor keeps a constant tumbling action in frozen element. More keif than you can believe!!!! NO STICKS!!!!!! Perforate drum. We have gathered over 10 pounds of keif from a f__ed up crop. Good luck.. thanks but wouldn\\'t one of the lower prices portable washing machines work just as well for this purpose even if not branded for this purpose don\\'t th There is one that costs less but u do not get sifting bags at lower price and reviews stated more leakage with these..

I installed it some time ago, but i think it\\'s 4inch. because the lights are on the back of the unit does it give sufficient lighting all over the stove? Hello. Yes. It has three settings for lights. 1st, the lowest is to me is sufficient and the two and three settings (modiym and highest) should be enough. I think. Now one detail That has been bothering me is the vent/fan is close to the wall and does not cover well the two front burners. But it is still an awesome appliance. And I would highly suggest you do everything possible to expel the air to the outside of the house. If you leave the air inside the hood I\\'m afraid to tell you, the exhaust is 85% inefficient.. I have 9 food ceilings. Does the hight adjust properly and would I need to purchase anything extra to make it look right? It will adjust to fit your 9\\' ceiling. You will not need anything else to make it look right. We are extremely pleased with the look and performance.. Does the glass on this hood require very frequent cleaning? Not really unless your very fussy. Yes, it gets a little grease on the underside, but it\\'s not that noticible, even up close as it\\'s sitting about eye level. All you really see is the edge of the glass, not the top or bottom. . A couple of sprays of windex does the trick.. Is this for mounting over an island or does it have to attach to a wall? Over island.. Was wondering if anyone used dry wall anchors to mount this. Studs don\\'t line up No. Does this product come with the necessary hardware to vent it through the outside, adjacent wall, without the need to purchase any kits? No - i am a custom builder and have installed 2 of these - need 6\" swivels, ducting, tape, strap, roof vent. What are the sones for this product?

It is a great drainer - very stable.. Can I order an extra utensil holder for this drainer? Aloha, It comes with two utensil cups that can be moved around anywhere within the dish rack or removed entirely if you like. I have found two to be sufficient for my needs. It is NOT as the picture describes with only one cup. Whether you can order one or two more holders I don't know.. Would this be a good choice for drying glasses, mainly champagne glasses? Yes - for hand washing it is ideal.. What color is this dish rack? It says avacado but the picture is of a white/ clear rack...

Yes the chimney is a 2 part design that can extend to at least 10 feet. The aluminium filters have dents after the installation (no smooth surface anymore). Where can I buy new ones?

They are equivalent manufacturer parts. Local stores sell this item anywhere between $50-$70. Amazon has a much more reasonable price for this common part.. I have a G.E. wall oven jgrs14 gep. the oven does not light the broiler does but only for a few minutes. is it the Ignitor ? is there two ignitors?tha I have a GE Spectra regular range,not a wall oven. There are seperate igniters for the oven and broiler. It was not too dificult to install ,after I found a YouTube clip on how to do it. I would have no idea how to install the igniter in a wall oven. Check the internet and YouTube for your model.. Does this igniter coming with those two porcelain wire nuts (Supco T1164 Porcelain Wire Nut, High Heat, 18-14 Wire, Small Size #1) shown on the picture or that have to be purchased separately? It came with the nuts (2). will this work for GE XL44 Model 317B6034? Yes. I have a GEXL44 model # JGBS21SEV3AD will this igniter work for this model? Yes. wiil this work for model jgbp3dbew1ad Yes,This will work on your model. I have a Kenmore Model # 362.75875690 Will this part fit? Thank you. If the original part number is WB2X9154 it will fit and take less than 15 minutes to put in. I looked up your model number but could not find your exact part number for an oven ignitor for a gas range. I think that this is your replacement part but check on the internet to be sure.. will this work on a GE oven JGBBP33BEH5BB? Not sure I used partselect.com to find my part number. is the wb2x9154 5 aps for ge oven I'm don't know about the part number in your question, but the part I purchased worked for both the oven and the broiler in my GE oven.. \",\n",

That being said, the more drinks you have on the top two shelves, the less light you have filter to the bottom shelves. We leave the light on all the time, it makes a nice nightlight in the kitchen. Hope this helps.. It says 18.5 x 17 x 33 inches. Which is the width and which the depth? The depth is 17, the width is 18.5.. I would like to buy two, can I purchase a left and a right hinged model? BR-125SD door can be reversed.. Can this be used outdoors? I have mine in my garage.... It supports well the heat on sumner. If it's for an open area, but protected from the rain and direct sun, it should be ok.. Is the door reversible?? No. Is it an under the counter refrigerator ? We have it under the counter, but if you have room I do not see why you could not put it on the counter. We have vented it from the back, it seems to work much better when it has good circulation behind the unit.. Is it auto defrost or manual There is no ice compartment so it should never need defrosting. Possibly, if you leave the door open for long periods some frost could form on the back wall in which case it would be manual to defrost it.. Can you remove the shelves for the cans, so that it would support a row of beer bottles? yes. \",\n",
       " 'Is there an on/off switch with this replacement ice maker? Not a switch, a bar that can be raised up to stop the icemaker from making more ice. When the ice container is full, the ice holds up the bar which also stops the icemaker from making further ice until some is used. There is a detent above the full ice level you raise the bar up to in order to stop it.. My GE fridge is set up for an icemaker, that is to say it has the 4 pin off center connector and cover plate. My question is will I need a pump motor? no pump is required. water pressure from your water source forces water into the icemaker where it freezes and is ultimately expelled as cubes when they are frozen. no water pump is used in the process at any time. the short answer is, no you will not need any kind of water pump.. I just installed this ice maker, lasted ONE WEEK and failed, it burned up internally. Now it floods my kitchen. How long is the warranty? You need to contact the seller for that question. You may have a problem with your water valve not shutting off, bad valve or control board.. do this one replace the WR30X10044? as well by General Electric ? The short answer is probably yes. It has fittings for most installations. You might note that this unit makes seven cubes at a time. My original GE unit made eight at a time, as might yours. My original GE unit ran for something like sixteen years. This one has been running almost a year. I don\\'t notice the difference in cube production. In my opinion, this unit\\'s construction is very inferior to the original GE. I doubt that it will last for sixteen years, but who knows? The cost was much lower than any other exact (8 cube) replacement unit, GE or otherwise.. What type of warranty comes with this unit? I bought one from another supplier and they gave 30 day warranty and it broke at day 31. I don\\'t know what kind of warranty it has but I have mine for a year now and it works great.. where the water comes in from the back of the door there is ice forming in and around the tub. Is there a valve there that is leaking and does thsi ki This kit does not replace the water output.. u might have to defrost your freezer once to get it working properly. will it replace WR30X0327 icemaker Yes, it will. My OEM GE icemaker WR300X0327 stopped working and the ERWR30X10093 was a perfect replacement. It is making buckets of ice.. What is the +/1 screw for, ie what does it do It allows you to adjust the size of the ice cubes... take a lesson from me though if you make the cubes to big they will not separate easy. Will the original ice maker \"stripper\" work with this replacement ice maker? The stripper strips the ice from the ice maker mold. Thank you! The new unit has a new \\'stripper\\' on it. Don\\'t make unnecessary work for yourself...... Do you have another fill cup? None of the fill cups fit. My fill cup is on the right side of the freezer, w/water entrance hole in back Did you figure out what to do? I have the same problem. No matching fill cup. GGGRRRR. ',\n",

       " 'I am wondering the vent out air way is on the back of the wall or go up though the cabinet? Thanks! Both options available. Do I need a special Power Cord to plug this and the non-duct kit into a standard wall outlet? Yes, you would need to somehow attach a cord to the bare wires in order to plug it into a standard wall outlet. You would also need the non duct kit. I bought it and had a duct made for it. I really like the hood.. What\\'s is the minimum and maximum distance allowed between the bottom of hood and range top? I think it was listed as 18\"-21\" for electric ranges. I have mine at 24\". The higher you go makes it less effective, the lower it is the more in the way it seems.. can the 4x10 duct be reduced to 6\" round safely or will it reduce flow too much I reduced to 6\" round and it works perfectly. does the shelf come with it? no, but you can purchase matching backsplash with shelves (see Broan site).... What non ducted recirculation kit should you use this range hood with? I do not not have outside vent I do not have non ducted install. I do not know what your situation is regarding the application but if you cant duct it, the result wil be limited; not just for this brand but all brands.. in my over range cabinet the air way is around, do I need buy this\"Broan 411 3-1/4\" x 10\" to 6\" Round Duct Transition, NA\"when I buy this range hood same time? So I can connect this hood with the vent out air way? Thanks. Yes. You need the adapter to connect to the round ducting.. What are the real height, width and depth of this range hood? Measurement in inch: H: 9 W: 30 D: 20 3/4. Has anyone used this to replace an over the stove microwave unit? Does it stick out too far to look good at that height? Thanks! No it looks great better than a microwave especially at that height.. It is listed as .7 sones in one place and 7 sones in another. Which is right? 0.7 at normal speed and 1.7 at Max speed.. ',\n",
       " 'what is the overall minimum height on this? I am looking for 22-24\" high. Diagram ht seems to point to chimney ht not overall ht. thank you! The chimney flue comes in two sections. You can mount the fan using only the upper brackets and one of the outer chimney covers to have a short height hood. If necessary, you can cut the chimney cover and brackets to make them even shorter. How low is your ceiling? You need to allow enough room above your stove to use your pots and not hit your head on the hood.. Will it fit a 10 ft. Ceiling? A 10\\' ceiling is too high in accordance with the manufacturer\\'s recommendation. Thank you.. Fro new construction, should the attic duct be centered front to back above the stove or more towards the back of the stove? I\\'m not sure as far as function but myself being 6\\'3\" I wish I would\\'ve installed it back a bit.. I\\'ve banged my head off it a few times . Hope this helps. can this be used without any modifications or cuts on a 9\\' ceiling? We installed ours on a 9\\' kitchen ceiling, but we have a working vent, so an opening was made in the ceiling for the venting. You should be able to install it without an opening on a 9\\' ceiling.. Looking for ventless, I need to know where to buy charcoal filters.. Expensive? Work well? This unit comes with the charcoal filters necessary for ventless operation. No separate purchase is necessary. Thank you!. The aluminium filters have dents after the installation (no smooth surface anymore). Where can I buy new ones? Try to contact the manufacturer. Go on their website and obtain the customer support phone number.. Are the lights dimmable? its not dimmable but the light is not overly bright so l dont think its necessary. A very pleasant light bright but not overpowering.. Do you ship item to PR? Sorry, we do not currently ship to PR.. I just bought a model without led lights, do you sell a kit that allows for upgrade to led lights (it looks like simple plug n play for switching) No. Hi All: My ceiling duct is 3 1/4\" x 10\" rectangular. Is there room in the \"chimney\" to fit an adapter to accommodate the 6\" round duct? Thanks! Yes there should be room for a transition from rectangular to round pipe. The distance from the top of the exhaust duct connection, to your rectangular duct will restrict you some. The exhaust fan and damper extends up into the stainless steel trim approx. 12 inches . The trim section is approx. 12\" wide and 11\" deep.. ',\n",

       " \"Is this made in the USA? No it is not. The product is made in Canada.. Has anyone else had problems removing this filter after using for some time?? I have had a Swift Green installed for a while and the light recently came on to replace. I bought a new filter but can not get the old one to budge, we have now broken the... I don't think this will be helpful to you now, but I recently replaced my Maytag filter with the Swift filter and it leaked instantly. I took it down and replaced it with another Maytag filter and its doing great now. I'll only buy the Maytag filters from now on. Best of luck to you.. Does the filter label indicate the number of gallons of water it will treat or flow rate ? Do you notice a difference in water flow rate ? Kirin reports 1137 liters/3000 gallons but 1137 liters is only 300 gallons, not 3000. Someone else reported 300 gallons, so it appears this filter has a much shorter life than the UKF8001.. Will it work in a Whirlpool? Model number is the same. I would check if the part number for the whilrpool is listed as a replacement or compatible. That's what I used when I checked for my Refrigerator. what kind of filter is it? Coconut hull, very 'green' made in Canada. We will buy this again next time!. Does it fix whirlpool french door water filter? I've had very slow water flow, but switching back to original Maytag filters did not help either. I've not gotten around to having a repairman out because of the high expense. I think the filter is as good as Maytag, but these water dispensers are problematic.. this product says it can be used in my Whirlpool refrigerator. Since it has been installed, our ice maker no longer works. What is the issue? keep taking it out of the 'socket' and refitting it until it is in properly. At first I thought I installed it the right way but neither my water dispenser in the door or the ice maker worked. It was only after I gave it a very strong turn to the right and heard a new click I hadn't heard before that I knew I installed it correctly and water began to flow. I'm not the handiest person but I can hold my own. This was a very tricky install in my opinion and requires some patience and strength.. Does this fit a Jenn Air refrigerator From my home work-yes, BUT I have since thrown both of them in the trash. I wrote a review that stated why but in the end the weight was off, to lite, the water passed through as fast as when the filter was bypassed and I felt the water was not properly filtered. In the end I spent a little more and bought a couple of Maytag brand which also fit our Kitchen Aid. And now the water flows at the same rate as when the refer was new.. I have a Whirlpool Refrigerator - Manual indicated replacement filter of UKF8001AXX-200 - Is this filter compatible? Not this one. Use the Maytag original equipment, not the copy.. The model number in the Product Info is SGF-M10, however on the box and image the model number is stated as SGF-M9. Is xx9 &amp; a xx10 the same product? I do not have my box.

I found that when re inserting the filter back in, you must align it up and then turn it and then re align it up for it to fit properly, you should find this in your manual, or look it up on the internet for a copy of your manual.. it is a bit tricky and also check to make sure you reset your ice back to ON. and not on vacation setting, all of this is in manual. good luck, hope that helps.. Why is nothing coming out of the water dispenser now after replacing the filter? It may not be \"seated\" correctly. If not positioned correctly it will not work. If you have not taken it out and re-inserted it into the fridge, try that. if you shut the water off, make sure it is on. You may have a bad filter, try another.

I have to put it under a shelf. What is the total height with the top opened to maximum height? Thanks. A little less than 53 inches:). Can I wash king size sheet set in the SQ AWN542? Easy. We wash work clothes that have grease &amp; farm dirt on the jeans. How does the Speed Queen do on heavily soiled items? Don't know about grease but my Speed Queen AWN542 works very well on yard dirt. It has a powerful agitator. Plus all Speed Queen top loaders have a soak cycle that should help with the grease but I have not had to use it yet. One minor nit with the soak cycle is that after it is done you then have to run the load through a entire regular cycle but an easy workaround suggested by other owners is to use the regular cycle but lift the lid on the washer after the initial fill to let the load soak. After it soaks for a while just close the iid to run the load through the rest of the cycle. You can't do this with a modern HE machine. The only other recommendations I have is to use lots of water (easy with a Speed Queen) and don't overload the machine (especially with jeans.). Why is the size so small? 3.3 cu ft seems pretty small compared to what is on the market. I wash pretty big loads of clothes. The size is sufficent to wash large loads we have a family of 4-6 depending on how is in town. Don't be fooled by the large sizes other washers. I had a front load that said 4.0 and it could not affectively wash that size load. I have owned a lot of washers this truly and old fashion machine that really works. You tube all the other brands and you will see all the horror stories and complaints. Size don't matter you need a machine that works. The tub could 10 cu ft but if you cannot get clean clothes its worthless.. model 542 has a fabric selector switch...what is the purpose and do you find it helpful? The AWN542 has a fabric selector switch that separates control of the agitation and spin selection speeds from the timer. This option gives the user more control over the wash cycle when compared to other models. All other models incorporate the agitation and spin operations into the cycle selection timer. A KNITS or DELICATE fabric selection with a REGULAR or PERMANENT PRESS cycle selection delivers a constant slow agitation coupled with selectable fast or slow extraction spin. None of the other models operate with the constant slow agitation feature in a complete cycle. The AWN542 continues to incorporate traditional Delicate and Hand Wash cycles that utilize intermittent slow agitation, extended soaks, and slow speed spins to perform a gentle wash. Another unique option is the ability in the SOAK cycle to use a fast or slow agitation and spin extraction.. Has anyone else experienced ripped jeans or pants in their Speed Queen as one reviewer mentioned? Thank you. We have not experienced ripped jeans or any clothing in ours. We did however have a full sized comforter torn while trying to wash it in this machine. It was no fault of the machine, the comforter clearly stated front load machines only. It was far too large to be washed in this washer. After half a year or so with this machine we still love it.. Does this unit have an agitator Yes, Mark this washer does have an agitator. I have put the washer through it's paces since delivery and have washed bath rugs in it, the heavy cotton bath rugs that weigh a ton when wet. This machine has done so with finesse and with out bouncing around. I will try to upload pics of the agitator for you.. How long is the average wash cycle? Our average wash cycle (i.e., normal regular or normal perm press) with our average load (large setting) seems to go about 30-35 minutes. Add in an extra rinse cycle and it is about 45 minutes. No issue for us since this is still faster than our Whirlpool WED4850 dryer (which we also like a lot).. How noisy is this machine? Would you put it in a room next to your bedroom? I would say the sound level is mostly 'average' -- no beeps or buzzes, but lots of swishing and humming. However, the loudest part is actually quite loud, and lasts maybe 30 seconds. The first time I heard it, I thought something was wrong with the washer, but after talking to a technician, was assured it was normal. I think it happens at the end of the rinse cycle, when the tub is spinning very fast, and water is pouring in for the rinse, and the clothes are getting compressed against the side. Due to this, at some point the clothes are no longer covering the bottom of the washer, and the water pouring in is hitting the empty bottom of the metal tub directly. This sound of water hitting the tub is startling, and probably child-waking loud if it's near their room.. \",\n",

I sent it back to greentech environmental and they replaced it free of charge. Then the same problem occurred.

Not at all. I have been using it over a year now with a septic system. If anything, it is better for it as you aren\\'t releasing detergent into it.. how long will the pure wash last Mine has been working for 14 months for a family of four and we haven\\'t purchased laundry detergent in all that time. Purchased the High Efficiency version - ran it for a standard washer for about 4 months and then replaced the washer with a high efficiency 10 months ago. Because it generates the gases when it runs, I see no reason why it won\\'t last for a long time.. I have an HE top load Kenmore Elite. Which model do need? Low Flow model. Where is it made? China. i have a high efficiency washer. Since the price is the same can i use the high flow model on a low flow machine? No. Due to the small amount of water used in an HE washer the Purewash designed for HE washers has a small output and concentrated ozone action. If you use the high flow on an HE washer you will get very poor results from your Purewash due to the diluted ozination.. Can the gray water from the washer be used to water plants or will the change in pH affect the plants? The gray water would only contain water (H2O), Ozone (O3), Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), and whatever dirt would be on your clothes. Hydrogen Peroxide is only slightly acidic at 6.2 on the ph scale so it shouldn\\'t be enough of a change to make a difference in your plants.. Does this unit release any ozone gas that could be dangerous to breathe? No it does not. ',\n",

Is this one quiet enough that it won't wake you up in the middle of the night? it is in my opinion.... also the main thing is that it is the coldest mini fridge available on the market all the rest are semi cold and this one id freezing cold ... great for beers. do you have deforst? This is a different frig. There is no frozen food compartment. I have found, by experience, that models that have the frozen food compartment , it is useless. This model has a plate that covers the back of the whole compartment. The cooling coils are behind that. There is an automatic defrost with a drip pan that takes care of any frost build up. It works very well and is quiet. I have found that the food I put on the rear of any of the shelves gets and stays quite cool. I hope this helps.. what are the dimensions of this frig? 21.5 x 20.5 x 33.1 inches (copied and pasted from the product description above....). what is the temperature range? Can this be adjusted to 50-55 F for cheese aging? there isn't a thermometer in the unit. It of course has a thermostat but I cant tell you the temp sorry. Can this unit be built into a bar or cabinet? Shouldn't be a problem. Is this Danby model suitable for outdoor use? This model is excellent as a cooler for canned drinks and vegetables. It is better than the usual small refrigerator as it does not have to be defrosted. The outside of it is not sturdy enough for outside use. I have had mine for 3 years and it still works fine.. Is the crisper remoavable? Yes, the crisper is removable.. If I used this Refrigerator at the max power setting, how much would I pay monthly energy wise? (AZ) To put this briefly it will not last a month so it's hard to estimate the power use. PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid this refrigerator and the manufacturer in general at any cost! Hope this helps you.. Can it be built in your kitchen with cabinets around it? Yes. There needs to be some clearance around it and behind it for air circulation, so the cabinets shouldn't be completely flush with the unit - check the manual online for the exact clearance specifications. We have had ours a year now and are very pleased with it.. \",\n",
       " 'Can you exchange the singe tap for a double tap on this unit? If you\\'re asking if Danby will do that for you, I can\\'t answer that. But a double tap tower will fit just fine on this. I replaced mine recently. Just make sure the demensions of the tower base and the holes for the screws match up.. Can you put this under a counter and mount the tap on the counter? Will there be a large hole in the top of the fridge I will have to insulate? I put mine under counter and mounted tap to counter. Used a small can of the foam insulation to seal the hole on top of fridge...no problems. Technically, this is a free standing model but I did not want to pay the extra money for a true under counter model. I have decent ventilation space under counter and no problems so far. What\\'s the best way to clean the lines? Also, do I need to clean the lines before I use it for the first time? \"Beer Line Cleaning Kit\" available on this site. i did not clean the lines when i first used it. the parts are in a sealed bag.. Can you fit 2 1/6 kegs in there with the tank on the outside? Yes. got this and all we are getting is foam and flat beer.very disappointing went through several different sites to troubleshoot and nothing has worked. The sleeve clamp that holds the tubing to the keg coupler is crimped to tight. Need to cut it off and redo it with a regular tubing clamp.. Can beers such as Corona be tapped with the parts included? Yes they can its a standard tap which most beers have. Some Foreign beers need a European adaptor. will coors kegs fit in this? The center of the coors kegs bulges out. No it will not. Tried and ended up having to exchange keg.. Will this fit 2 corny kegs for homebrewed beer? Yes it does.. Do I need a different regulator to run two different kegs? No. I have two kegs in my kegerator (I just use a picnic tap on the other one if I want to use it).. \\'What size is the faucet threads 5/8 or 7/8\"? Sorry I have no idea. I bought a Danby and ended up returning it for their TERRIBLE customer service. It didn\\'t work for me and their customer service was the worst. Just fair warning.. ',\n",
       " 'does anyone know if this will work if the dishwasher is sitting lower than the sink? There is nothing in the Instruction Manual that says anything about the height of the Washer related to the sink, so I\\'m assuming that it wouldn\\'t be considered as a problem. A pump does pump out the used water after each cycle, so with only a 4 foot set of hoses, I doubt the height of the Washer would be an issue. It would of course be wise to go on-line to Danby and check with them. The Danby countertop Washers are great when you don\\'t have the room for a full sized Washer. This is the 3rd one I\\'ve had as they do have a life span of only 2 to 3 years, but for the price, replacing them isn\\'t all that bad.. Can this be mounted under the counter? It is not designed for that. It does need to connect to the faucet. But with the proper tools, space, and engineuity I suppose you could make it work.. How long are the wash cycles? The longest one, the heavy is 1 hour 45 minutes, normal 1:25, light 1:15, glass 1:10, speed 45minutes and soak 10 minutes. The dishes do not come out fully dried when it finishes, they may have some water drops on them still. So what I do is open it when the cycle is done and leave it open for ten more minutes, then they fully dry.. The only area this will fit is to put it sideways. Would there be problems, and how long are the hoses? I don\\'t think you can put it sideways - probably would leak. Maybe Nick B can share the product he bought.. Does this run quietly? When im in watching tv you dont even notice it until it changes the water because it drains in your sink. or at the end it beeps telling you it is done I am very happy with mine.. What is the interior measurements? I don\\'t know. I bought it for my daughter. She said it holds at least 4 place settings comfortably and a couple of glasses.. I have small rental units. a couple of questions- where does the unit drain? Are there drain hoses? Do you have to continuously connect to faucet? can connect and unconnect to faucet pretty quickly (locks in) but if you dont have a standard faucet head it may be annoying or impossible. the units drain into the sink, there are 2 hoses, one going in and one goes out back into sink.. Why does the manual warn against using with an extension cord? I have no outlet in my kitchen that\\'s close enough. Manual can be downloaded here: http://www.danby.com/en/US/our_products/specialty/ddw611wled. I prefer hand washing my table settings but don\\'t do not always have time to hand dry. Can you use this to dry only? No. Sorry. There\\'s no dry setting. There\\'s also the fact that it doesn\\'t always leave your dishes dry at the end. In fact, it almost never opens at the end of a cycle without spraying you with water droplets. Never stand so your face clears the door when you\\'re opening at the end of a cycle. That\\'s the Splash Zone.. After reading the reviews, some people say their plates don\\'t fit in...would someone know what size plate will fit in? What the diameter max is? Thanks MY plates are 9 3/4\". Still a little clearance. Looks like a 10\" plate max.. ',\n",
       " 'does anyone know where we can get aluminum filters from? please let me know. thank you! Hi, I don\\'t know, however, the seller has been very helpful for all inquiries I\\'ve made so far.. Diemensions: 30\"Wx24\"D the cut sheet says 35.43w, which one is right? 30 is more accurate. They do have a 36 that would be the later. where it was made, i mean country China, mine had a bad circuit board that went bad after about three weeks. It took four months to get the replacement. But, I have had no issues since.. Can this be used with a 10\\' ceiling? No, the product description says 8\\' to 9\\' ceilings. The height is adjustable but if you mounted it on a 10\\' ceiling you would end up with too much clearance above your cooktop.. is there a web sight for the internal wiring for the lights they stopped working I was able to get the document set which included the wiring diagram; but I don\\'t remember just how I did that since it has been a couple of years now. I believe I researched the mfg name, the searched via Google for documents online. That worked for me and it was free. Just a note of caution; our ceiling is only 7\\' (dropped for a design reason) so hoods like this one will either hang low or will requir an expensive modification (fabrication). If you ceiling is at least 8\\' you are good to go.. Are the lights halogen or what? Yes halogen or u could use led. installation What is the question?. Can someone tell me what the minimum height from the ceiling this hood can be? I don\\'t want to exceed 24\", just want to be sure it can be adjusted. If you are talking about the height above the range top, it should be about 28 - 32 inches. My installation is 29 inches, the governing factor is you don\\'t want to hit your head on the vent unit when you lean over whatever you are cooking. The fan motor is powerful enough that we rarely use the high setting. As to adjustment, the unit as provided has the ability to adjust, but in my case, the ceiling was tilted and slightly too high, so I had an extended stainless duct piece fabricated (~$130) to make it all work.. Can anyone tell me what\\'s the minimum height of this hood? I have a very low ceiling and the height of the hood has to be less than 25 inches. Thanks I cut mine to fit. I have a 8.5foot ceiling. Is the lighting LED or standard lighting? The lights are Halogen. Hot! Can be replaced with LED at $20 per. Light sockets can be a challenge to work with though.. ',\n",

I am not sure how your washer compares with mine. I did not see that number listed in my manual, However, I know they change over the years. I bought mine in 2004. The picture on the Amazon site should help you see if they look alike. The dimensions have to be the same. I wish the best for you in your search. RuthHatfield. ',\n",

Is this valve compatible with the Whirlpool MOD SF462LXSS0? Yes it was and it saved me from purchasing a new stove.. is this the right valve for sf362lxsy0 (whirlpool model #)? Yes. Is this the right valve for Whirlpool GS563LXSB0? Most likely this is the right part. This valve is used on just about all digital controled ranges nowdays, kenmore, whirlpool, etc. Use an ohm meter to check the valve. Center terminal is neutral, check continuity on both outside poles. If you get no closed circuit on either pole you have a dead coil in the valve. One circuit runs the bottom burner the other runs the broyler, top burner, but if one solinoid is dead neither will work. Six year old range and the valve went out. Best price on Amazon!. \",\n",

Yes, This product come with all the items shown in the picture. Our low limit thermostat went out on our Kenmore. The part number matches this one (3977393) but wrong dryer brand. That doesn't matter does it? This kit is replaces both the thermostat and upper limit sensor. The thermostat is different form the one on my dryer. It will work but I looked and found an exact replacement and didn't use the one in the kit. Don't worry about the name the part number is most important. Kenmore is made by Whirlpool, GE or a host of others and the parts can come of independent manufactures. All the information I read recommends that you replace both at the same time. Hope this helps.. Are these the: 1) Heater Box Thermal Cut-off fuse part#3977393. 2) Hi Limit Thermostat part#3977767 for the whirlpool LER4634JQ1 dryer Yes they are. Does this kit fit the WED4850XQ1? Does this kit include both the cut-off switch and the 3977767 Thermostat? I don't know about the number but my kit did include both parts. It is best to replace both as they are dependent upon each other. It is a simple fix.. Does it work with CEM2940TQ0 ? I am buying also 3977767.. Do I need fuse for this dryer ? It's coin operated electric dryer I didn't get a fuse. I did replace the heating element along with this. It worked great.. how many pieces was this? 2 pieces. \",\n",
       " 'I need a new PTC sensor? what is the ohm spread on the PTC? water temp at 92 and control says 138 unit only 2 months old my manual says that the basic sensor is -40-300F with 3\\' 24AWG 2 conductor wire. Nickel plated copper sensor cap. Also an upgraded sensor is a 1000Ohm Platinum RTD sensor that goes from 0-600F. Would this be an effective devise to control the temp in my smoker which uses a electric smoke generator. You may want to check the temperature range of this unit and see if the probe can take the temperature of your smoker. If the range is within your specs and you are able to use the output to manipulate your smoker to increase or decrease the heat, sure why not.. I need to keep a converted freezer at 65F for dry curing meat but occasionally need to heat to 95F for a day or 2. Can I program this unit to do it? You sure can, but you will need to change the temp on the days you want different. It does not have a day of the week function, so you will have to change the settings when you want the temp to be different. Make sure the upper limit is set high enough so when you change the temp - it only takes a few seconds. I use it on a freezer for beer fermenting. It is normally one temp range, when I lager I just make a quick change in the temp setting and I am done.. is there any alarm during high or low temp.? Not on this model. I think Control Products offers a different part number that includes an audible alarm.. Compressor delay? Does this unit allow a programmable delay for use with a compressor so as not to shorten the life of the compressor? Yes, this unit has a short cycle delay of 0-15 mins so it doesn\\'t cycle too quickly.. What is the diameter of the supplied probe? I\\'m wanting to fit it into a 1/4\" ID stainless tube to use as a thermowell. I measured it with my micrometer, I got 0.2502 inches.. Possible to turn relay on when set temperature is reached and then shut off after 10 minutes? I\\'m trying to connect this to a pump that will turn on when the temperature has reached 130F and then run for 10 minutes and turn off. Is that possible with... No..It is designed to turn on and off at temperature set points. There isn\\'t any way to control the \"time\" when it hits a set point. The only time setting is in-between the low shut off point and the high turn on point. If you were heating in a refrigerator with an element then it shuts off it is here you have control of the time..(it\\'s called controlling the \"short cycle\")..after it shuts off there will be some residual heat at first then it will be absorbed or dissipate in short time...like 8-10minutes. So you set the \"lag\" time for like 15minutes, so then the controller will not check the temperature for 15min. THEN turn off if it needs to cool down more. That is the only time control in this controller. The only way to work in your case is you would need to place a 10min. timer between your controller and the pump. the problem being is you\\'ll need a timer that re-sets after it shuts off..Not easy,but not impossible either!. I need to control a blower motor, but I need the blower to turn off if temp A is lower than temp B. Mike, This control would work for your situation. All the parameters are adjustable so yes you can set the set points of whatever the environment you\\'re monitoring with this unit.. can this be wired to a 220 air conditioner? Yes it can. But double check with the manufacturer.. Are there two standard 110 outlets on the back or bottom of unit, or does it have to be hard wired. There are no outlets that come with the controller. Additionally there is no power cable. All of this will need To be hard wired into it.. ',\n",

       " \"how do I turn on the drying cycle? This machine does not have a drying cycle. That didn't bother me because I haven't used one most of the time for years (to save energy). What I do is time my load (whenever possible) so that I am around when the cycle ends. Then I turn it off, open the door, pull out the top rack to keep the door partly open, and let the dishes air dry. If you do this shortly after the cycle ends, while everything is still hot, most dishes will dry well. You can also wipe of the tops of glasses and cups if they have pools of water..

The ice is a half moon shape and ours is what I think you are calling white ice, a little white a little clear.

It is the same part as the original and it will be a perfect fit. Glad to be of service. Have a blessed day.. does pump work with maytag model mhwe300vf00 Not sure but my model, wfw8300sw02 whirlpool duet sport, was also not on the list of model numbers and it worked on it. I trusted the pix of the pump. It looked like mine and it worked.. Whirlpool Duet Washer &amp; Dryer Pedestals I used that pump for my Whirlpool Duet that i bought on 2005. It is important to remember that the same part fits both Kenmore and Whirlpool.The Kenmore Part number is 8540024, the Whirlpool Part number is W10130913. Also pay attention to your original pump installation footprint - I saw different parts with different installation pads. New installed pump works perfectly well - we forgot about problem at all. Don\\'t over tight hoses to the pump. Installation is easy and takes 10-20 minutes maximum.. The picture you have listed is backwards from the part i Have in my Whirlpool Duet Sport washer. In my washer the pump is on the right of the drain trap. Is this just an image thing? Also, I have the pump removed from the assembly, is there any reason... The picture is actually upside down. The picture shows the mounting feet on the top while when installed in the machine the feet point down and are attached to the base of the washer. Another interesting aspect of the picture of a pump is that they managed to hide the attachment points of the two hoses. The inlet hose attaches to the back of the trap chamber on the left foreground of the picture. The trap keeps change and other debris from entering the pump. The pump itself is in the middle of the picture. The outlet extends at a 45 angle and cannot be seen becaust it is directly on the other side of the pump. The tan cap covers the motor and is normally on the right. Other than showing the pump rotated 180, the pump is in the correct orientation in the machine. You can open and empty the trap from the front without removing the pump. Removing the pump is tricky as you have to depress the black rubber padding on the feet in just the right way in order to remove the pump. Search YouTube for videos on how to do this. Be prepared for water! Since the pump is located at the bottom of the machine it cannot pump out all the water. Using a wet-vac to suck water out of the exaust tube gets rid of most of it.. the pump i\"m replacing list # 854oo26 on it will this work Whirlpool W10130913 Water Pump for Washer was the recommended part (by several internet sites) to replace the original part in our Kenmore HE2 plus washer. It worked perfectly (identical to the original part) and was very easy to install. I hope this helps you.. In the product picture above, is that yellow pump casing supposed to have any water inside? Emile D., Sorry for the delay in my response I just opened your email. The pump casing should not have any water in it. You may have a leaking seal in the pump itself or you may have a leaking seal in washing tub/drum that leaks water on to the pump. Either way the entire area in which this pump is located should be dry. Perhaps the pump can dried out. It might work if it is not shorted out. Fix the leak first. If there is water in the casing, the cause of the water must be remedies before you put in any new pump. Visually inspect the seals and repair or replace as necessary.. Anyone know the difference between W10130913 and PS1960402? They look the same ~$20 different. I would definitely cross reference the model # of your washing machine. They look really similar. The ps1960402 could just be a old model # of the pump. I have a whirlpool duet sport ht model #wfw8400tw00 and the w10130913 was a perfect replacement pump.. should the water drain pump be hot? To the degree that you are pumping out warm water, it may be warm. But if it\\'s actually too hot to touch, something is wrong. It\\'s working too hard.. Do I have to change the whole part or can I just replace the motor part? The motor and pump are a unit and replaced together. Make sure you watch the video on changing it as it helps a lot. You don\\'t need to remove the screws under the pump unit, just lift up the rubber retaining flap and pop it out. Should only take about half an hour to change.. I need to order a water washer drain pump model number is WFW8500SR01 but i cant find it if I order the W10130913 will it fit my Front Loader Whirlpool Sport Duet? Need help finding one.

Also in my washer, the \"new\" suspension part was a little different (well, more like improved). I\\'m not sure about your Kenmore Washer, but I installed a new \"improved\" wash plate in my Whirlpool, and it seems to help reduce some of the twisting of clothing (the new impeller has three tall/long and three small \"blades\" and they are all narrow, the old impeller had three large/wide raised areas).

Simply, if the external temperature in the garage or storage area drops below the setpoint that would normally turn on the fridge compressor, the fridge will not start and the temperature in the freezer portion can rise to the temperature of the external temperature, i.e., above the freezing point, and well above the recommended storage temperature of the freezer. The device is a little heater coil that imposes an artificially warmer temperature on the refrig temperature controller that \"fools\" it into thinking that it must turn on to preserve the cooling in both sections of the fridge.

Not sure what the extra C in the model number stands for. The ice maker works but it is not an exact fit because the design has changed. I had to adjust the arm that shuts off the ice when the bin is full because it didn't stop making ice.. i want to order this part can you confirm that it fits Frigidair model GLRS237ZDW2 (mfg 9-2004) We have a GHSC39EJP, purchased 7/2008. Ice maker was a duplicate to the malfunctioning one we removed. Works great. Seems to make ice quicker than the original, too! You'll have to ask Frigidaire if this replacement unit fits your model.. i have a glhs68egpb5 refridgerator by frididaire, is your 5303918344 ice maker for this fridge? hi - im not sure why you are asking me, because I am simply a customer -- so you must have sent the inquiry to the wrong location -- I can tell you that if you search for the icemaker you need on an appliance parts site, you will be able to get the product number you need and then match it to the ones sold on amazon for less -- I bought mine for an electrolux icon fridge. works great but the on/off switch does not line up exactly with the slot on the plastic trim -- worth the 50$ saved by buying this product -- hope this helps. \",\n",

There isn't a green light or a sound that I've heard. You really can't tell and the cycle takes several hours.

       " 'Has anyone used this for cloth diapers? I just bought one for cloth dipers and it can wash about 6 diapers at a time.. we use flats and pockets. it does a great job for us. I would recomend wringing them out between rinses. I do a 5 min pre-rinse, 15 min wash and 2-3 6 min rinse cycles. workslike a charm.. Is this the BEST countertop, electric washer there is out there? Yes! I believe so! Being single and on a tight budget this has come in very handy! My apartment has my water and electric included in the rent so I purchased this washer and a spinner as well. I don\\'t have to lug my laundry to the laundry room, hope I have enough money to wash and dry, nor do I have to worry about any of my clothes being stolen. The only small flaw that I have found this to have is that if you have thick plush towels the size of beach towels, it will not work correctly as the weight of the towel is too heavy for this, even if you just wash one at a time. I only have two such towels that I use when I go to the pool and all my other towels are the standard size and those I can wash two at a time. when it is time to wash my comforters which right now I am not using until winter time I will have to go to the laundry mat to wash those. But back to the plush towels, I just wash those by had in the kitchen sink and rinse them then I put them in the spinner and they will come out almost dry. I have gotten my monies worth on this product as I wash every week and I even wash my queen size bed sheets, flat and fitted in this washer, one at a time, of course of it beats them getting stolen from the washer in the laundry mat and having to buy new ones! I have also bought a grey colored hose from home depot to use to fill the washer faster with water because the hose it comes with is too small and it takes forever. I have only spent $6.00 for the hose and I have used both powder and also liquid detergent in this washer. If you like powder, fill washer first then add the powder and stir so the powder can dissolve, then add the close. It\\'s just a little extra work but I would do it than spend $10 a week and having to sit there and wait for the clothes to wash, this way while I wash, I can do other house work or watch tv because once I don\\'t hear the timer anymore then I know it stopped. I hope this helps! :) One more thing, if you can find a small table to sit it on, I have a small table that is lower than the sink but so this way when it\\'s time to let the water out I just unhook the attached hose into the tub and let it drain. I don\\'t even squeeze the excess water out of the clothes because you don\\'t have to use more than a tablespoon of detergent. I just put clean water and set the timer to 15 minutes and let it rinse, then I let the water out again, take the clothes out and put it in the spinner and set that timer to two minutes and my clothes is clean and almost dry. I hang them to dry on hangers on this clothes rack and 30 minutes later, my clothes is dry. The thickness of the clothes depends on the time. I also set the clothes near the A/C vent so it dries quicker.. This doesn\\'t need to drain while in operation? I am a truck driver and would like to place it in seat, want to make sure it doesnt shoot water out It has a drain when the drain hose is unhooked & lowered. If its on a hard or firm surface & not over filled it should\\'nt spill.. Has anyone used this to wash bed linens? Can you fit a queen sized microfiber blanket in it? I\\'ve washed a set of twin sheets + a towel, but a queen blanket would probably be too much.. How long will it be used untill it doesn\"t work? I have had my Panda for 2 months now, and it continues to work very well. I am hoping that it continues to work well, I use it at least 3 times a week, and do an average of two loads each time. So far, I have not had any adverse problems with it.. Can I just use it to spin clothes? I handwash delicate clothes and need spin them to remove water. This is a washer; not a spinner. A separate spinner is needed to wring clothes.. How long does this last? Has anyone been using it for like an year or so? It has been over two years that I have mine; in regular once per week use. The original hose is still intact and in use (many complain it breaks; not mine). Have had no complaints so far.. Does the washer move around a lot when in operation? Anyone tried the Laundry Alternative mini washer plus with rinse cycle? Hi Not really This washer is for small wash like baby cloth and it is small. does itspin the cloths The unit agitates the clothes during washing by spinning one direction, pausing, then spinning the opposite direction. The time is set with a manual timer. It does not spin to remove water. Normally I put clothes in and let them soak; then agitate approx. 10 min.; soak; agitate around 10 min. Then drain, remove clothes and wring out, replace clothes to rinse, and duplicate timing. I rinse twice. Watch that you don\\'t use too much detergent - it doesn\\'t take much. With too much, you\\'ll have to rinse more times. With the first few loads, I have to rinse 5 or more times to get all the detergent out. I I\\'d like to find a small roller wringer (like old washing machines) to go with this unit.. HOW DO YOU PUT THE WATER IN THE WASHER It has a hose that hooks to the faucet on your kitchen sink. It just slips onto it. If it doesn\\'t fit your sink (it fits most sinks), then you could simply pour half gallon pitchers of water into it till you get it about 3/4 full. Put clothes in first and then fill it. When the wash cycle is over, place the drain house in the sink and let it drain and then refill it for the rinse cycle. Six minutes seems to get our clothes really clean. Then 3 minutes for the rinse cycle. Less time because you have less clothing in it than with a full size washer. Overfilling the machine with too many clothes makes agitation (movement of machine to clean) impossible. Overfilling with water will cause some water to leak out the drain hose which is hooked in an upward position during wash and rinse cycles to keep it from prematurely draining. Machine fits pretty easily on the counter next to sink. You need only a small amount of laundry soap for each wash. It does not spin dry the clothes. You will need to wring them out or buy a small spin dryer. You could also place the machine on a table or counter and put a bucket under it for when you need to drain it. You could fill it via a garden hose. It seems to work well with cold or warm water.. ',\n",

I downloaded the decibel meter App, and with the fan running it read an average of 62Db = \"normal conversation\" (vs. 42Db = \"average household room\") .

Where can I get the acutal dimensions http://products.geappliances.com/ApplProducts/Dispatcher?REQUEST=SpecPage&Sku=CGP650SETSS This link to the spec page for the cooktop might help. are the knobs plastic or metal? The knobs are metal with a plastic insert on the bottom to let the lights glow through.. How thick are the grates? A similar GE cooktop has grates that are too thick and prevents the flame from contacting the bottom of cookware. The grates are pretty thick and very heavy. I have found that I have to use a higher flame on this cooktop than I used on my old one. But my old cooktop was very, very old. Takes a little longer to start heating, boiling, etc. but overall it cooks wonderfully.. What is the actual installed width of the cooktop? I'm pretty sure it's standard 36'. If you call company they'll give you min and max deminsions. I do want to tell you it scratches SUPER easily. I love the way it cooks but gotta be careful with grates scratching the steel.. can this product be used with propane gas? yes but you have to convert it with the other jets provided and take the spring out of the regulator valve. \",\n",
       " \"Anywone have the GE Gas Cooktop JGS750SEFSS - Do you like it and how hard is it to clean the stainless steal cook top? I got my cooktop 2 months ago and I love it. Stainless steel is very easy to clean. I normally just wipe it with a damp kitchen towel or sponge. If you get burnt on food just soak the spot with water for about 30 seconds and wipe clean and it looks brand new. This stove is great!!!!!!!. Does the griddle come with the unit or is it an accessory that needs to be purchased separately? Yes it does come with the Cafe model...the griddle is not attached and is very handy to use...we keep it on the grill all the time...I don't know if they send curing directions with the stove but you should cure it with olive oil...put olive oil all over it and turn the griddle on low heat as possible and keep it on for at least two hours...you only have to do this the first time-before you use the griddle...don't let the oil get too hot...just enough to cure it...the griddle is solid cast iron...use the same curing method for all new cast iron pans. Hope this helps...it's a great sstove. David. Is this cook top available for propane? Yes, comes with a kit for LP. Does the cooktop have enough room for all burners to be used at the same time with regular pots? Or is it cramped? It is a little cramped, and learned real quick to use pot holders with the heat moving up the sides. Didn't need to use pot holders with electric tops.. I bought this and tried to install it. There are gaps just at the rounded corners between the cooktop and the granite. Can anything be done? Alaa -- It sounds like the opening is larger than that called for in the installation instructions. I installed mine and did not have that issue. Since your countertop is granite, there is little you can do now, except maybe fill those corners with something that is close to the color of the granite. Regards, Russ Walden. Are knobs metal or plastic Plastic. Anyone have an issue with their pots and pans wobbling on the cast iron grates? No, mine sit evenly on the grates.. Two questions: What are the BTU ratings for all the burners?, and What are the distances in inches center to center between burners? It's worked good. Thanks! All BTU are burns good . the distances in inches center to center between burners is just one or two second.. My Cafe series appliances have a grey logo, the picture shows a red logo. What color logo will I receive? Production changes at GE in March of 2013 on the Cafe series appliances included the new dark gray/black logo, replacing the red logo. I would think that all of the red logo Cafe appliances would have long ago been sold, but it probably wouldn't hurt to contact the retailer to verify that you would be receiving new stock with the latest color logo. I haven 't seen any red logo Cafe appliances in quite some time at local stores. I have seen plenty of advertising with the old red logo displayed, but likely that would be the retailers continuing to use older advertising material.. Are there metal knobs that can be purchased to replace the plastic ones? Karen Thats a good one! My knob are sold metal with a plastic spacer under them. Came that way.. \",\n",

       " 'Can the lights be replaced with brighter ones? I just took it apart to look at those LED light housings. They are very easy to access. I loosened the four screws that hold down the glass cover, lifted it up a bit and could easily see the light housings. They are held in only with a clip, and by pushing down they come out easily. (You could probably just pry them out from underneath with a thin knife blade, working carefully so as not to scratch the surface.) The housing is connected with a plug to the 12V DC circuit that powers the LEDS. You can dismantle the housing by removing 4 small (PH-0) Philips head screws. That allows you to see the circular circuit board that holds 9 surface-mounted LEDs. The device is rated 12 Volts DC and less than 2 watts, meaning the current draw is less than 0.167 amps. Someone who knows the current market in LED surface mount devices could probably locate a circular board of similar size that contained some higher lumen output LEDs. (The technology on these is improving rapidly.) Or the manufacturer could get smart and get some themselves and offer us replacement plug-in units. But none of this helps you now. I was surprised how bright the 9 little bulbs were, and first thought maybe the diffuser was the problem in diminishing light output. But when I held the circuit board up in position without the diffuser and turned off the kitchen light, I could still see that the output was too slight. Anyway, although it doesn\\'t immediately solve our problem of a low-lumen light, it was fun research. I took pictures, but can\\'t figure out how they might be posted here.. I ordered this hood with the carbon filter so i could use it as a ventless,ductless unit, please tell me its possible, Is it ventless too? Yes, it\\'s quite possible. No need for ducts, but make sure you have the carbon filters. If the filters are not installed, all the exhaust will filter into your walls/ceilings which is not good. Installation is pretty easy, but you also need 2 people because it\\'s heavy. Also, if you can use toggle bolts to secure the vent to the ceiling, much more secure than the items they give you. It\\'s a nice looking vent, I would for sure recommend.. After we trimmed the chimney it left a black line of melted material around the edge. Tried to remove with goo gone and it won\\'t come off. help! Try a stainless steel pad, very gently. I cut mine down and did not have that problem.. I have a 7ft 8in ceiling. Will this range hood work for that? Also, we don\\'t want the hood the hand more than 24 inches from the ceiling. the hood range is designed to remove steam and odors from cooking. find a book at the library/google it on maximum distance from the stove top to the lower hood. If the hood range is too far a distance from the stove top than you have defeated the purpose of the product, the range hood is adjustable, I built a frame for the hood range since it weighs over 50# and used 8 screws to hold up the range. I did not use the screws that came with the range, JUNK. I used 3.5 inch deck screws with washers, total 8, drilled my own holes for the mounting plate. the most difficult task is connecting the vent tube, since it is metric and not standard, will be challenging because it will not fit into the 6 inch vent, need to stretch the vent collar. Just remember the vent is adjustable for height. get a piece of string and tape to ceiling and cut to length of range height. from the bottom of the string measure the distance from your stove top, is it within proper ventilation height requirements from stove top to the bottom of the hood range. Most important will this pass a home inspection IF you sell your home one day. Use foil metal tape to secure the connections seams, available at Home depot.. What is the shortest height that the chimney can be adjusted to? Thanks! Best I managed was 25 inches. Its not ideal, its right at eye level. If anyone was able to get it shorter, I\\'d be interested in hearing.. can you provide installation instructions for this model? i am not sure I have enough room and want to check it before I buy. It is an island hood so you do need some space for it. You also need electricity, ducting and another person to help put it up. It\\'s a great looking unit. The stainless scratches easily so you have to be very careful when installing it. The vent stack is adjustable so you have wiggle room on the height. Do follow the instructions carefully. They are very specific about how far above the range it must be so as to maximize the ventilation.. what is the biggest wattage you can put in, I have one and like it but want more light I\\'m not sure what the watts are but the led lights that came with it a very bright.. What is the size of the packaged product to be transported? I don\\'t remember. It was pretty big though. I would say maybe 42\" X 32\" Depth was maybe 30 I think.. What size duct work does it require? I think 6 inch was the standard size. The contractor went into the attic to brace it and used the existing duct work.. Is there any advantage having a LCD display unit over the standard button unit. Also handy man is asking $600 to install it with vent. Is it fair? Nice to have the timer and clock display.

Note it only displays military time.. what is the dimension of the hood shaft that goes into the ceiling We have this attractive hood as well. I'm not sure of the shaft itself but the outside box that covers the shaft is an 12 incheby 12 inch. Our handyman tossed the bracket hardware and accordian type vent pipe. He felt both were lightweight and for few dollars did his own upgrade. It is very attractive once installed. We were left with a small ceiling hole and just used a crown molding type trim that matched our new cabinets to close it all in.. Can anyone tell me what's the minimum height of this hood? I have a very low ceiling and the height of the hood has to be less than 25 inches. Thanks Don't really know the answer. The installers had to cut down the height of the hood but it still is over 25 inches.. What's the difference between the GVAI-30 and this one other than the clock? I don't see anything in the specs to say otherwise. Only difference is the clock display. how do you change the lights in the fan I haven't had to do it yet but I pulled out the instructions that came with it. Wording is confusing but I followed instructions and then in mine is mounted over an island. I can see the wires and arrows referred to in instructions when I look from the back side of unit. I don't want to take it apart - but if you haven't looked from the back side that might help. If I could figure out how to insert a picture I woukd send that and a picture of the (confusing) manual page. If those might be helpful to you, I'd be happy to email them to you but I'm not sure how to get my email address to you without posting it here.. Can anyone tell me how to turn off the annoying beeper? The instructions - which are full of poor grammar - doesn't help. what beeper?. Can this hood be wall mounted? No. This hood cannot be wall mounted. It is meant to be mounted to hang from the ceiling.. is it ventless/ductless No. It vents to a duct which is then vented outside.. Will this range hood work for a 7ft 71/2 inch ceiling? We also do not want the hood to hang lower their 22 inches from the ceiling. My ceilings are 7 1/2 ft.. And it hangs 22'' from ceiling.. But I do have the stack venting out through the roof... Can this be used as a ductless system? If so, what is needed? No. I dont think you can. It is not set up like that. In order for the unit to be ductless you would have to change and modify inside parts cap off the existing exhaust , replace filters, and cut out another vent right above the glass for air to recycle. Similar to the standard hoods. It can get very expensive to modify.. \",\n",

The microwave and stove really finishes out newly remodeled kitchen............. Can the burners be lit during a power outage? I live in an area of common ice storms, so that's a make or break for me. Yes, you just have to use a match or a lighter. However I would not purchase this range, our oven will not hold a consistent temperature, some days it is right on, the next day it is 50 degrees off. We have had repair folks out three times and they say nothing is wrong.

It's especially good for baked goods.. Would you buy the 5 burner again if you knew that it would not heat up like you hoped it would? I think it heats fine. Even they smallest burner in the back will keep a large pot of sauce/liquid simmering on the lowest setting. The front burners are very strong, much hotter than any stove I have owned before. I use the middle burner for very large pots, or griddles. We have 3 kids, cook and bake everyday. I love this stove and would definitively buy it again. However, we had to adjust the burners when we bought it, because the flames were too low.. griddle I don't know what you want to know about the griddle.

Are the upp and lower ovens are BOTH gas and convection, or just one or the other. Can anyone clarify? trying to decide between this and profile. Both ovens are gas. Only the bottom one has convection. The top one is much smaller and only bake and broil.

Only the lower oven has rollers. I don't know if the top oven does broil but the bottom does.. Can you buy additional ball bearing racks? Thanks. This is THE ANSWER I got from GE. Hello - this is Nancy at GE and I am happy to help you. Yes, you can purchase an additional roller rack to use in this range. To purchase same, please contact the Parts Center at 1-877-650-2121 from 7am to midnight ET, seven days a week. I hope this helps! Thanks for checking with us!. i bought this range for my daughter. It burns food close to the sides of the oven when she uses the upper oven. Is there a way to correct this? I have the same oven. There is a way to adjust the temperature. You will need an oven thermometer. I put one in the oven and turned it on to 200, then checked the temperature. If correct, turn up to 350 then check. Keep raising temperature to check it at all degrees. In the manual, it tells you step by step how to adjust the temperature control behind the knob. Try that to see if what the knob is set to is actually the temperature inside the oven. It may need to be adjusted, hope this helps !. Is this a down draft stove? No it is not. The vents in the back are to vent the stoves. It is not down draft.. Some dual fuel top burners will not light during a power outage due to a built in safety feature. Does this one have that safety feature? The range has a gas lockout feature. When enabled will lockout gas to all burners plus oven. Otherwise during a power outage burners will light with a match. Ovens will not. (Only if lockout is not enabled before pier outage).. Is the fan really noisy? I was set on buying this but read the reviews about the fan being really noisy. We have an open kitchen/living/family If the fan to which you refer is the convection oven fan, the answer is no, it is not noisy. The unit appears to be well insulated from sound.. Does it require venting to the outside? No. However if you don't have any kind of ventilation (recirculating or outside) if you cook smokey/smelly things your house will get smokey and smell. That is true of any range.. LP gas users (Propane users) how would you rate the output of the burners? Who did your conversion to propane? The burner output is great. To be honest, I do 90 % of my coming on the front right. This one has a range from fast boil to simmer with a small center burner. This is a stove you will enjoy.. \",\n",

A super clog that must be cleared with a pole.. Is it 6 inches long or six feet long? thanks 6 inches wide 4 feet long. What about snow? Any problems I should know about? None that I've encountered.. What gutter guard is best for long pine needles? The plastic type with a mesh fabric glued to the underside fell apart putting needles We just have the sample and have not installed it yet but expect to get the Leafsout brand when we some help to install it or I decide to try it myself. It is aluminum and stainless steel and the mesh doesn't look like anything except water can get through it.. Does using these gutter guards void the roof warranty? You should discuss this with your roofer to be certain, but it would be VERY surprising if it did.. Has anyone tried fitting this product with heating cables to help prevent ice dams? Which cables work and how difficult was the adaptation? Heating cable for this gutter LeafsOut protector probably would not be satisfactory unless the cable ran the full length of the gutter to downspout. Electrical energy consumed by the heating cable would be cost prohibitive.. Are ice dams more likely to occur when using gutter guards? I added gutter guards when I had a new roof put on 6 months ago. I don't have a good answer to your question. However, I didn't notice any particular difference this winter.. What # stainless steel are these? Are they the good stuff or the Chinese stuf that rusts? I've had mine for several years and they show no signs of rust. Seem to be made of quality material.. \",\n",
       " \"recalls on whirlpool cabrio Have not heard of any, but they should. Has any one had issues with bad smels from their cabrio washing machine? I've started to get a black mold in mine. Tide and clorox now make product that actually cleans your washing machine to get the mold and stink-smell out.. Why can't I smell the fabric softener after the wash is done? I don't know. Of all the issues I had with this machine this isn't one I remember having to deal with. I no longer have this washing machine, I replaced it in December after my last frustrating experience with the service issues I wrote about.. I got my Whirpool Cabrio in 2006, it's still working great but is rusting on the inside rim and I'm wondering why? I always left mine open to air it out until it was completely dry, only because it gets a funny smell. If it's rusting, to me that's a sign of it's not drying completely. I don't have any idea how you can get that rust off. I will never buy a Whirlpool washer or dryer again. I now have the GE front loaders and I love them! The washer has a rubber seal and after I'm finished washing for the day I do dry it with a towel. I, also, dry the inside window, then leave the door cracked open to make sure everything on the inside dries completely. Sorry about your rust problem and hope you can remedy that.. No water come in an it hummming Sounds like the pump is shot.. what is best way to load clothes to avoid unlevel load ? I just try to arrange the clothes around the perimeter of the washer as even as possible. Do not overfill or it could become unbalanced.. water leak on floor want to know anybody had prob with hoses under machine I've had some water on the floor but not enough to worry about it, yet. My husband found some good videos on You Tube that he found helpful in taking the washer apart and repairing it.. What does code F6 mean ? Sounds like either a failed MCU ( motor control unit) or a bad CCU (central control unit). Or wiring issue between the two. Probably need to call whirlpool for a repair man. Unless you are very handy. Check your user manual. Hope this helps.. Reviews of the Whirlpool gas dryer wgd6200sw2? We have the electric version of Whirlpool Cabrio, it works fine. I think my old Kenmore worked better in removing lint and hair, but this will do. No real dislikes.. my washer will not come on. it makes a humming sound like it wants to come on and spin but it do not. have this happened to anyone else. We had that issue- there is a two stage motor and I bet the starter portion of motor is bad. Try to tape the door button and push start button and push the drum counter clock-wise.. \",\n",

In the picture looks like the shelving is made for wine bottles and for them to lay down. I would like to use as a beverage cooler and have cans, water etc. Does it have flat shelving that I can set cans/bottles upright? If not can I order replacement... Shelves are shaped to hold wine bottles. I use mine for bottled beer and soda. I removed the bottom shelve so I can stand beer bottles upright on the bottom, and lay soda cans sidewise on the shelves. Works, but would also like flat shelves, if they are available. Haven't looked much, but if anyone else has found them would like to know.. Does anyone know where I can get a replacement key for this? I lost mine and need it now that we have mobile 8 month old twins. I would call the company.. How do I turn off the light as it is locked on and I can't get it to unlock? Tried to hold the two buttons for thirty seconds but nothing happens? You cannot change any settings if the frig us locked. Hold the two buttons in until it beeps signaling it is unlocked, then push the light button. After you set settings as desired, then hold 2buttoms in until it beeps signaling it is locked again.. two questions, Is the door reversible? Who manufactures this product? Where made? The door is not reversible. SPT is the manufacturer. We're not sure where it's made.. What is the coldest temperature this unit will cool to? I purchased the cooler for a house we are renovating. We have not turned the cooler on so I cannot say how cold it will get.. warranty The product broke down after the first week that I installed it...had to send it back....didn't want to replace it with the same product due to the hassle.. How much does the actual temperature fluctuate as it cycles on/off throughout the day? If I set it for 55F, how close does it stay to 55? Unless you are are stocking it or have the door open for an extended period, the temperature will remain constant.. Are the doors reversible? I do not know I went with the unit as it came. \",\n",
       " 'I don\\'t know how to set the timer. Plug it in and turn the dial to the correct time. Insert a green pin at the time you want the device to turn on, then a red pin at the time you want it to turn off.. When the timer trips from On to Off, do you get a spark? no. Should the switch be turn to on or off for it to be used as a timer? Either mine isn\\'t working or I don\\'t know what I am doing... Huh? This apparatus is used to turn things on and off so you don\\'t have to manually do it yourself. I have my turtles basking light plugged into it so the light turns on in the morning and off at night without me ever having to touch it. Are you looking to mark a certain amount of time that has passed, or are you using it to turn things on and off? Did yours come with instructions? Here, you know what, this might help a bunch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRzhGNOo1bY. Is the device small enough to leave one free outlet or will it take up both spaces? Assuming you put it in the bottom outlet you still have space for a regular plug to be used on top.. After I plug the lamp into the timer device should I manuially turn the lamp on or leave it off? You have to turn the lamp on, but it won\\'t be \"on\" until the timer completes the circuit (i.e. until it hits the on period that you want). Does it make any clicking sounds while in use? It does subtly whir and tick as it keeps time, yes.. is this timer good for ouydoor use I\\'m going to say no to that. I mean, you COULD, but I wouldn\\'t count on it lasting long (or being safe).. How much power does the timer itself consume? These timers have a geared one RPM/day motor so in reality bare timer power consumption can be ~ 0.1 Amp (100mA) negligible compared to the 15 Amp tolerance. Be careful not to use ANY timer in an enclosed location where you store gasoline, paints or other flammables. The contacts arc (spark) and that works like a spark plug to ignite (explode vapors). Use indoors (not sufficiently sealed) and in locations free of ignitable vapors. I hope I answered your question. noisy May become a little noisy after several years of use.. Can I make this timer just have 1 on/off instead of 3? Yes. Simply insert one green \"trigger\" for on, and one red \"trigger\" for the off time. Keep the others for spares.. ',\n",

       " 'Faucet attachment giving me problems. The water coming from faucet when not connected to d/w is highly pressurized. Is this normal? In a word, yes. But if you\\'re interested in the why/how, one may consider this: standard kitchen and bathroom faucets have a device located where the water exits, called an \"aerator\", which is usually comprised of a piece of steel screen, and a couple of metal or plastic components inside. This little gadget screws into the end of the faucet, precisely where you installed the adapter for the dishwasher. The purpose of this device is to intermix the exiting water with lots of air in order to increase the volume of the liquid by generating lots of little bubbles. This is why the water coming out of most faucets appears to be white and bubbly, instead of a steady, clear, stream like you would expect to see from the end of your garden hose. A faucet with an aerator produces a more controlled and gentle stream, and because the device mixes in lots of air, less water is needed in order to produce a steady and useful flow. In other words, aerators have the cumulative effect of drastically reducing both the volume of water and the exit speed of the water at the faucet. If you have noticed a difference in water pressure after installing the adapter for this dishwasher, I would venture to guess that you had one of these devices installed (99.9% of faucets do have one) and that you removed it in order to install the dishwasher adapter. So in summation, the good news is that if all my assumptions about your circumstance so far are correct, what you\\'re experiencing is normal. The bad news (if it can be called bad?) is that you have to put up with a slightly more powerful, less ruley, stream of water coming out of your faucet. In that sense, it does represent a trade-off of sorts, however, it should also be pointed out that many people remove the aerators from the kitchen faucet on purpose, for the express purpose of achieving the higher pressure and flow that you\\'re experiencing. Attempting to install the dishwasher adapter to the end of the aerator will not work because the dishwasher adapter will prevent any air from being drawn in to the aerator. If your faucet pressure is so high that it is a problem to use, the best advice would be to adjust the valves under your sink until you attain a more desirable rate of flow. I hope this helps!. Can I fit a large pot or pan in this? And would it clean it good? It\\'s alright if I have to put the pot or pan in alone for the wash. Like all dishwashers it does have a pan size limit...for example: even when I had a full size maytag it would not hold my lobster pot. Nor would it clean something baked on completely. That said I am able to fit my 5qt dutch oven in it as well as (but not at the same time) my 6qt stock pot. Also it washes my 9x13 pyrex baking dish beautifully. The cleaning power is more about the detergent and how the items are arranged than about the dishwasher itself.. Does the dishwasher come with a warranty separate of the warranty you can purchase at checkout? I never got the choice at check out. But I really don\\'t recommend buying this. Mine broke a week after the 3 month warranty ran out. I called customer service and they did nothing to help. It\\'s not worth it. Go with an actual brand and service protection. May be more expensive but it\\'s worth it in the end.. I want this unit but I need the connectors to run about a foot longer. Has anyone hacked into the the lines to extend them? Do tell! We purchased this dishwasher about a year ago and the lines that came with it to connect to the sink were horrible and ugly! My husband is very familiar with plumbing so he was able to buy a few extra parts and hook up to the sink line which worked perfectly. It is now in a cabinet out of sight! I do not know what exactly he purchased, but I can ask him and get back to you, if you\\'d like?. Being this is portable does it have a hookup that hooks up directly to the water faucet? I have a similar one from 2008 and it does. I recall having to get a small adapter for my faucet at a hardware store though. My machine has been working perfectly for almost 5 years now and never disappointed me. Totally recommend it!. can you hook it in perminantly? Yes, you can hook it permanently. I bought it to use it on my RV and it is going to be installed like a regular dishwasher.. How many dishes actually fit in? We are a two person household, how often should I expect to run it? We are two in here also and I use it everyday, once a day (when we are out working, on weekdays, I use it every other day). It fits 6 dishes and I have tried to put a pan in it but it didn\\'t get cleaned. Careful not to stuff it otherwise nothing will be cleaned, including your forks and knives.. How many dishes actually fit in? We are a two person household, how often should I expect to run it? It depends on your dishes, I run mine twice a week. Once on my big cooking day and then again at the end of the week. I live alone. The last day is mainly cups.... do I need an adapter for the faucet hookup? The adapter that came with the dishwasher worked for us, it fit on the regular faucet after the screen fitting was removed.. What is the 3 in 1 setting on the machine? I just purchased this and can\\'t find what it specifically does I\\'m not quite sure either, but my best guess is that it accomodates the 3-in-1 cleaning packets that are sold. Like the cascade ones with the triple cleaning power. I looked through the manual for an answer and came up short, but I\\'ve been using that setting with the packets and everything works well....

What do you know about the Kenmore 3.4 cu. ft. top load washer 20022? I have the Amana washer, and I've had it for a bit over a year. It has worked very well for me. I found out it pretty much locks up as soon as you push the start button, ergo everything needs to be in before you push the button to start. Beyond that it works great, very reliable. The top comes off the spinner to put in fabric softner. That's about it.. I have the worst sewer smell coming from this machine. What gives? Probably because this washing machine is a piece of crap...sorry I don't know what it is, but it doesn't really wash my clothes, so the smell is probably just buildup from all of the dirty clothing. Maybe try running an empty cycle to clear it out?. how do you open the top when you have no power? Don't. The lid-lock mechanism in this unit is easy to break, and costs over $100 for just the replacement part.. how can you stop the washer from draining out when you want to add an item? First thing I'd try to end the siphoning is to elevate the washer's drain hose. If the washer's drain hose is shoved deep into your home drain pipe, pull most of the drain hose out of the drain pipe and anchor it in that position. The added height should correct the problem.. I have the top load but it has a lock when it starts. How can you get the lock to disengage to put fabric softener in the rinse cycle? Hold the lock button down for 3 seconds.

I clean the inside of the rack where it sits at the side of the sink. I scrub and then tilt toward sink and use my sink sprayer to rinse. I do this with the bottom drainer tray back on the unit (after its been cleaned). That way all the water drains right out to the spout and into the sink as I spray. One area I can\\'t get too is where the draining spout connects to the drain tray. Looks like it will get build up over time. I suspect I\\'ll have to soak it or maybe put in dishwasher. Some of the pieces are dishwasher safe. I\\'m just not sure which ones but think it says on box. I have to check.. Is the direction of the water spout adjustable or is it only out of the wider side?

It has 4 slots for steak/paring/smaller knives, 2 for med chefs knives and 1 for a large knife. Had it now almost two years and its still the best ever.. Are all the legs on this (height) adjustable? Just wanted to confirm before ordering since I have a considerable lip to my sink. Well yes and no, it comes as you can see it on the picture and it also comes with four rubber pieces to put on each leg to lift it a bit to maximize the draining I guess. I just measured it and the lowest part below the drain (that black shoe horn that sticks out) comes to 3 cm in height. the four rubber pieces you can put on each legs lifts it about 2 cm...anyways just send me a message if you want more precise info :). Wondering the clearance under the drip spout? We have a ledge around our sink we\\'re trynig to get over! the dish drainer stands on legs and the drip spout is approximately 2 inches from the counter top. Hope this helps. I really do like it and it actually holds more dishes than my old plastic wire thing I had.. How many plates can this hold? There are 3 in our household; however, my frame has in it a complete service for 4(large plates, salad plates, cereal bowl, 8 mugs, 6 ceramic ramikens, 3 Pyrex dishes with covers(small), two eight inch iron fry pans, and one small fry pan. Additionally a few large cooking and serving utensils. In the knife rack are various knives, and a spatula. Only two of us drink an occaisonal glass of wine. The wine rack holds two goblets, and the potato masher, on the front portion of that area, are kitchen shears, potato peeler, and a can opener. Most of these items are used daily and are handy from the Steel Frame Dish Rack. Everyone who sees it wants one!. can the wooden knife block be removed? I would like to use that space for more utensils.... Yes.. ',\n",

It works very well I have the avanti and I have no problems with it,to avoid over heating don't pack the dryer with a lot of clothes in it also clean the filter after each use.its a good product and works just like any dryer ,. My daughter has this dryer, it has not worked for a year. The repair people say they are unable to get parts to fix it. Did she purchase it with a credit card? If so she could have them dispute it like I did. They refunded my money and then went after the manufacture. However since it has been a year it may be to long but worth a try. I didnt have to send the dryer back either.. Can you put it on a stackable piece? i bought a steel wire shelf from walmart and used half of it to raise dryer to comfortable height and I locked it to the shelf with the feet on the dryer through the wires, I put detergent and clothes under it. I have never had a stack-able but, never set anything on it. Ive had mine 2 years of heavy use. love it, forget filters I bought felt squares at wally world and cut new filters out myself. less than $2.00 for 2 sets of intake and lint filters.. Would one of you check to see if the wattage draw is on the label on the back of the machine? Yes, there is a label In one side: rated votage 120V AC. Rated frequency 60Hz. Rated current 12.7A. Power Input 1400 W. can i blug into wall This dryer will run on any 110 volt outlet in your home as long as you do not share the circuit with a microwave, or coffee maker, etc.. Is door reversible? no. This dryer use 110 or 120V? 110. Which settings to use for permanent press, so its wrinkle free? Heat setting? How many items can i load? How long to set the timer? For permanent press-wrinkle free, Set timer anywhere between 60-100 minutes. The dryer should be loaded in such a way that the clothes loosely tumble and fall as the dryer turns. I suggest you see the manual as all is spelled out on page 10.. How many prongs does the power cord have? Is there a way I could see the cord? Standard 3 prong for 110 outlet. Plug into any USA grounded house outlet. Dont know how to add pic.. \",\n",
       " 'this prduct is made by us? It is made in China.. How much electricity does it use in comparison to the regular electric stove? According to the website \"Frigidare Cooktops\" it states, \"Induction is faster, easier to clean and more energy efficient than gas or electric.\" I couldn\\'t agree more! However to answer your question, the same site states \"- -our induction cooktop is 70% more efficient than cooking with gas and 20% more efficient than cooking with electric.\". 120V? I think i have 110V at my house in DC area. Can I use this unit here? Yes. No problem.. What is the minimum diameter? It will heat a very small diameter butter-melter-thinghy. No limit on how small you can go. You could put a 12 inch Cast Iron Fry Pan on it. but the size of the magnetic heating element under the glass is 7 inches in diameter so it only heats the center. Around the edge of the pan is not hot enough for max heat. A problem for saute, but not to boil water or slow cook, depends on what you\\'re cooking. I use my 8 inch cast iron fry pan a lot. Our 4 qt capacity enameled cast iron Walmart LeCrueset knock-off works great as such bowl-shaped cookware has a smaller diameter area at the bottom. For serious cooking with a Wok you should use an extra large gas burner. Good quality Tri-clad cookware with the induction symbol stamped on the bottom such as Fagor cookware works very well and is not very expensive. I have a tall 8 1/2\" diameter stockpot that holds 5-6 quarts that I use for soups, stews and slow cooking. The tri-clad bottom spreads the heat evenly, so thick stews don\\'t burn on the low settings. Most six quart stainless steel Pressure cookers work OK, though you should only fill a P.C. 2/3 full. My nephew uses it on his Cabin Cruiser because it doesn\\'t draw too much current. Works fine cooking for 2-4 persons. W.O.. Is there a \\'warm\\' feature that will keep something at 100 degrees? I\\'d like to use this to melt butters waxes, then hold them, for soaping There is no \\'warm\\' setting. You\\'d have to use trial-and-error to find what settings (and pans) work for you.. Does anyone find that just 10 heat settings is too restrictive? Do you need more accurate variation in temperature control for cooking? I am something of a gourmet cook, and have never felt that the number of settings was too limited. My only gripe, and it is minor, is that over time the lowest settings have become hotter. Used to be able to simmmer at 2, now simmers at one. Performance varies from pan to pan, and with some pans, 1 is almost too hot for a simmer. Over all, I am thrilled with the burner and recommend it highly.. What is the warranty 1 year parts and labour. maybe I am missing it but it does not say enything about the manufacturer.. what company makes this? Company\\'s name is Eurodib.. Can these induction cooktops be used to put a canning pot on and generate the proper heat to do the job? yes as long as you are using induction friendly pots-we canned with the Burton --same size heating surface.. Is it noisy? The one I bought by another brand has a constantly working fan that is uncomfortably loud. I wonder if it is an issue in all.) It is a little noisy but it was never enough to bother me. I was using it mainly for a teapot and I would say the fan was never louder than the boiling water.. ',\n",

The included remote will work wirelessly as a thermostat without Red Link.. Does this unit come with the Portable Thermostat or must I purchase it separately? It comes with the portable thermostat pictured.. How to wire for hot water heat and separate AC unit. Nothing in install manual. Honeywell 800 number won\\'t help homeowner. I can\\'t help; bought Honeywell package, over $300 and every air conditioning company I\\'ve contacted in Jacksonville, FL says they can not do the installation and recommend returning the product. Presently the components are sitting in the closet hoping some day there will be installation instructions on the net. Can\\'t believe major Air Conditioning companies do not like Honeywell products.. How long do the batteries last in the wireless temperature sensors? I installed my kit in mid August 2012. All batteries still working May 29, 2013.. Is it recommended that for a 2-zone house (upstairs and downstairs) that you get two of these units? I do not think so. This kit comes with the Main thermostat, 1 outdoor sensor and 1 Portable Comfort Control (PCC). The PCC can be moved around the house. In my case, I have a 2 story house and I keep the PCC in the second floor, at night when I am in the room I transfer the control from downstairs (main unit) to the PCC and the temperature in the room is kept at my preferred setting (Usually 78/79). There is a drawback: The Main thermostast and the PCC cannot be used at the same time in tandem, so you are reading the temp either from the main or from the PCC but not both at the same time. For example if I set downstairs to be 80 and the PCC to be 79 the A/C will not turn on to keep both settings, only to keep the one that at that moment is the master (either the main unit or the PCC). If you want to keep an average setting in your house, like having multiple sensors indoor and that the AC turns on to keep this average, then there are small indoor units (no screen) that are cheap that can be used for that.. What benefit do the sensors provide (supply, discharge, ourdoor)? Does this thermostat provide any utilization/temp reporting like the Nest? I have the indoor remote sensor (temp) and the outdoor sensor (temp/humidity) connected. When the remote is selected it acts as the thermostat and works great. With the smartphone app, the exterior and interior temp/humidity are viewable along with system status and control. I don\\'t know what a \"Nest\" is. Hope this helps.. Will it call out if temp drops below a set point (freeze alarm)? I belive you need the Red Link Enabled Internet Gateway for this functionality. http://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-THM6000R1002-Enabled-Internet-Gateway/dp/B006BD1K4A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1355862230&sr=8-2&keywords=YTHX9321R5061. Anyway to muffle the \"clicking\" sound these make. We have 2 in our new house and one was installed in master bedroom and wakes us up That\\'s a good question for either the Honeywell customer support online or 800 support center. Although, any sound that you are unaccustomed to, will disturb a good nights sleep. My experience has been, after having the YTHX in place for over 3 months, that your rest cycle will be less interrupted with the more familiar sound. However if you are a very light sleeper more drastic measures might be considered, such as replacing the thermosat to a more remote location. Fishing wires thru walls and ceilings is a moderate (experience level) undertaking. I had to run a fifth wire (previous 4-wire would not support the YTHX), and am familiar with the undertaking. If not, an ac or electrician can easily handle the issue. Good Luck.. Will the unit also control a humidifier? Yes, it controls humidity level in the house and can be set dynamically on touchscreen.. Does this thermostat make a loud click when turning on? My thermostat is in the bedroom, I require something with a soft, not piercing click. No click on my unit.. ',\n",

I'd like to set this up with the back close to a wall. Can I fit 2 corny kegs and the CO2 bottle inside the unit so it will be more flush to the wall? No. We have two, 5 gallon kegs in ours and it's a very tight squeeze. The co2 will have to be in the back. It's still a great kegerator though!. can you install this under a counter Yes, that's how mine is. Just need to drill hole in countertop. Granite installers did it and just used a lot of silicone to adhere to counter top.. can you install this under a counter Yes, depending on your counter height. You will need to cut a hole in the counter to feed the facet tower through. This model isn't specifically designed to be an undercounter model; there are others that may be a better choice.. We prefer nitro poured beers rather than CO2. Is it possible to use nitro with this dispenser? Yes. You need to get a nitro spout a nitro canister and fill with beer gas.. Does this come with the drip tray and chrome rail? Yes, comes with both. Been pleased with my purchase. Over 2 years and no problems.. Is the tower tall enough to run up through my counter if I install the kegerator under the counter? Yes, but you have to modify it.

I recommend watching Edgestar\\'s youtube videos about setup and maintenance. Very helpful--just search for edgestar kegerator.. my edgestar kegerator is making a loud popping noise about once every couple of hours I have this and I hate the loud popping sound.

Shutting off co2 won\\'t stop the pressurized keg from releasing beer. How tall is the tower (to know space needed under the counter)?Also, is there any reason the CO2 container can\\'t go inside on the shelf? The tower itself is about 12 inches. The height to the top of the handles is about 15.5 inches. I\\'m not sure what shelf you are referring to for the CO2. The kegs take up most of the inside. You may be able to squeeze it in there but there is a bracket on the back specificaly for the CO2. Hope this helps. What is the height of the fridge itself (w/o tap) and the height of the back rail? Can the casters be removed so the fridge sits on the floor? The casters come separate from the fridge, I didn\\'t put them on and it sits on the floor just fine.. Does this double faucet unit have the ability to turn off one of the co2 lines--if I only wanted one keg at a time? Not with the regulator that is supplied with the unit. The one that ships with this unit is a single valve regulator with a \"T\" connector for running CO2 to both the individual kegs/lines. I upgraded the regulator when I bought this unit (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060NOX40/ref=oh_details_o05_s02_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and I am extremely pleased with it, as it lets me shut the CO2 to each keg as needed. If you plan on having more than a keg active at one time, I really feel that this saves CO2 and gives you the ability to pressurize each keg as you need to. You can find cheaper dual pressure regulators, but this one is quality.. What is a good serving pressure (psi) and how can i tell if the flow is right? In general, most US produced ales and lagers should be dispensed at 10 to 12 PSI. Stout and other nitrogen reliant keg beers are usually dispensed at 25 to 30 PSI.. how do i get beer for it coors light Can\\'t get 1/6 kegs in my area and the full barrel coors won\\'t fit. Does the connection to the keg work with a pin lock system? My Corney keg has pin lock set up. The connection only comes setup for a Sanke connection. However, your beer shop will have the know how to inexpensively convert the connects to fit your system. I use 2 5 gallon ball lock corny kegs and the system works great.. ',\n",

       " 'How well does this wash eggs? The shells comes out white and clean... With no yolk residue to be found.. How tall is this machine? Does it have several washing modes (i.e. normal, gentle)? Also how does it drain? Thank you. Hi there ~ It\\'s about a foot and a half high, it doesn\\'t have a lot of \"modes\" but it\\'s pretty gentle on clothes. You can\\'t fit very much in it....a load of tshirts and underwear maybe. It drains through a hose that you aim into your sink. I always put mine on the kitchen counter next to the sink so that the hose from the kitchen faucet fills it up and another hose drains into into the sink. Simple and easy but for very small loads.. Can I wash a pair of jeans in the Eco Egg Washing Machine? No not really. I found that it was ok for shirts or anything smaller. I still had to do a weekly pants/jeans wash.. Does it have a spin cycle? No. it will drain out the water ,but u must wring out by hand.. How does it do washing cloth diapers? If I were a mother again, I would have no problem buying this product for washing diapers. It has a limited capacity, but it keeps the diapers out of the regular household laundry. For busy people it may be impractical beyond infant and early toddler size diapers. But that depends on how much you mind doing several loads a week. I wouldn\\'t mind at all. Cloth diapers are the healthiest. Babies do NOT need all the ridiculous chemicals in disposables. I say that with a little authority. I used to work in a research and development department of a baby diaper manufacturing company. Trust me. Cloth diapers are healthier than disposables. I would never let a disposable touch my baby if I didn\\'t have to. As for the egg, you could probably get a dozen and a half newborn diapers in it. Probably eight to twelve toddler diapers. I don\\'t think it is such a pain to hook up to a faucet that is in a second bathroom or a utility room. Otherwise it would be kind of a pain n a kitchen or only bathroom. The full wash is about thirty minutes. Wash and no rise is about fifteen. Just remember to turn the water off before removing the hose from the faucet! I wish my mom had it in the 1950\\'s and 1960\\'s when she had eight children and several in cloth diapers at any given time. I was an oldest daughter and often changed the cloth diapers and rinsed them in the toilet. Then put them in the bleach pail. I would have loved the ego egg. Just take the diapers out of the pail and put them in the egg. Run it and then wring them out. Throw them in the dryer or hang them up. You don\\'t have to mix them in with regular laundry and you can dry them together, fold them and put them away.. After washing, there is still some water in the machine. How can I get rid of it completely? I tried to select cycle to drain. I just turn the Egg upside down and pour it into the sink. The Egg is a little heavy but not too heavy to be able to do that easily enough.. Is anyone else having trouble with the inlet hose popping off the faucet adaptor once you turn on the faucet due to the water flow? Yes, that happened to me a lot of times ... That means you are not doing it right. The secret its to heard like a click ... Then turned the water slowly to see if the hose won\\'t come out.. Does this use regular or HE (High Efficiency) detergent? yes, its uses any detergent, including he. if my faucet doesn\\'t fit, can i pour water directly on to the machine? Yes. That\\'s how I use it.. Can you wash with hot water? By hot meaning as hot as the faucet can provide, which in my case can be hot, but not burning hot. Thanks. The hose leaked (bad, sprayed) when I just used straight hot water (lucky I heard it)... When I mixed or just used cold water there was no problem. After the hot water incident I had no problems with the hose leaking.... ',\n",
       " 'What is the height with the casters on? I have exactly 34 inches of clearance where the washer is supposed to go. The height is 33 1/2\" with the door closed. If you open the door, it folds in half and the height would be 40\". With the door unfolded, it is 46 1/2\".. Do the clothes come out linty? I can\\'t afford to buy a dryer yet. No they don\\'t come out linty at all! There is actually a lint filter in the agitator that catches the lint.. Does this portable washer come with casters, so it can be moved easily?? Yes it does. I have mine attached to permanent hookups but I kept the accessories and checked out the casters. They are not swivel but rather unidirectional so you would want to make sure you keep the machine someplace where you don\\'t have to turn a million corners to get it to the sink. I\\'ve also been meaning to edit my review to add a feature that wasn\\'t listed in the manual: a fabric softener dispenser. It kind of hides on the lip of the drum but it\\'s there. Just one more reason to really like this machine.. how much detergent do I use in the Danby 1.7 washer? I use about half of what I would on a regular washing machine, not a extra large tub washer.. how much clothes can you put in this washer It all depends on what you\\'re putting in the washer. As long as you don\\'t exceed the load capacity of 11.02 lbs you should be OK. This washer works best when the clothes are loaded loosely in the machine.. I am trying to decide between this model and the Haier HLP24E (the 1.5 cubic foot one). Has anyone owned both that can give a recommendation? I had the Haier model for about six months before it stopped working for me. I replaced it with the Danby and have been using it for about a year. It handles a larger load, and the agitator does a much better job of cleaning than the pulse action on the Haier.. Hello, We live in an apartment with the average kitchen sink. What sort of water hook-up is required? I assume the drain just vents into the sink. We live in an apartment also, and Danby provides you with everything you need to hook it up to an average kitchen sink. They give you a fitting that mounts on your faucet, and a quick disconnect on the hose so you can get it off easily. It vents into the sink, but we have to be careful to weigh the hose down or the water pressure forces it right out of the sink.. how many clothes can you stick in this washer You can put about 3-6 shirts/sweaters, depending on whether you\\'re talking t-shirts or hooded sweatshirts, and then add some socks, washcloths, hand towels. Jeans/pants - You could put 4 in, but sweatpants, I\\'d put 3, and again add some misc little stuff. With sheets - a fitted & flat queen sheet can go in together, but unfortunately sometimes it seems to cause one of them to somehow get caught over the center \"swish\" piece. So I typically wash one of them & add a bunch of other small stuff. Not for washing pillows or blankets - though you could toss a throw in. It does a good job, but the thing I hate most about it is if you keep it somewhere when not in use & then wheel it to a sink to hook up to water, the wheeling isn\\'t the most smooth in the world. This is primarily related to the leveling knob on the side, which can pop out of the frame a lot. So if your load is imbalanced with a bigger item (if ya can fit it), that helps level it, but then is a pain in the neck. It cleans well, but it\\'s definitely a moderate size closer to the small side than large. Hope that makes sense!. How do you hook this washer up to a kitchen sink? What kind of adapter is there to buy as some sites say threads are not long enough on faucet. I had this hooked up to my kitchen sink but later moved into the bathroom and all the attachments needed came with the washer. It was easy to hook up, I don\\'t recall any glitches at all. I have had this for more than a year, and I could not recommend this washer highly enough. It cleans my clothes so well, I\\'d been going to a laundromat for so long I almost forgot what really clean clothes smelled like. I have a couple friends who almost beg me to let them do laundry at my house because it cleans so much better than a coin operated machine. It is quiet, and doesn\\'t seem to use much electricity.. Can the water outlet hose be installed on either side of the washer? Thanks. The hoses for the incoming water supply cannot be moved, but the drain hose can be put on either side.. ',\n",

I try not to leave when it\\'s running. can this be built in? no - it is specifically designed to be a stand alone portable machine.. Does this dishwasher require strong water pressure from the faucet to function properly? No it does not because the hose that you connect to the faucet feeds water into the machine. Once the machine if filled with water it runs and begins to clean your dishes (similar to a washing machine).. Will it push water into a sink(higher from where dishwasher is kept)?Or will it need any plumbing work to fit pipe to drain? The answer to your first question is yes. The water input and output hose (consisting of two hoses) connect to the sink faucet. The water input/output hose is only about 3 to 4 feet long. No plumbing work is required it just drains into the sink. To understand the functioning of a \"portable\" dishwasher, you may want to look up some youtube vids - they all function the same way..

I don\\'t think so since it is as high as a standard counter, and you can\\'t take the top slab off.

Give yourself at least 3\" on each side of the drain. As for the depth you have to adjust it based on the slope of the driveway and the depth of the drain.. If I install it level with the driveway, is the inside pitched to carry away the water? No. You have to pitch the drain.. Can these be cut to a shorter length than 10 feet? Also can they be combined in length if I bought two sets to make an 11 ft length? Yes to both. They come in ~3ft sections that you slip one into the other to get the length you need. Like you when I installed mine i needed to cut one to get the exact length I wanted. They have been in for a couple of months now and are doing a good job funneling off the rain water.. Does this 3-pack come with installation legs so that I may have concrete poured under and not just around the sides? Does have flat bottom with slots to put bolts or anchors in .I pre poured mine and fastened it before floor pour.. ',\n",

Although the hot/cold hoses that come with it are the inexpensive rubber type. It is suggested to separately purchase metal or braided hoses which are stronger and usually last longer.

We are very satisfied with our purchase.. How close can the upper/dryer part of the machine be placed to the back wall? It looks like there is space to have an elbow and vent out the back.

       " 'how many years does this machine last before it breaks or needs and replacement parts? I have owned this machine for about one year, and I usually use it twice per day. So far it has run just fine, however, I do remove the filter and the drain plate one a month to clean them because they can clog which prevents the machine from draining properly.. Suppose I want to permanently install this to take the place of a normal dishwasher. Bad or good idea? Actually does clean dishes through varying cycle lengths with or without a final heated rinse program. Be mindful that if you decide to install this unit for continued use it will require some electric and plumbing accomidations 110 outlet, cold water feed, and waste water connection. This appliance is designed to sit atop a counter and be attached and disconnect at a kitchen sink. I have my dishwasher plumbed into my fridge h20 line and waste line plumbed into under sink drain line. My unit is situated atop my fridge. I can easily remove the entire dish rack to load with ease.. Does this have rubber feet on the bottom? The height will just barely fit under my cabinets (I think), and I want to be able to shave 1/16\" off. Yes mine does about 1/4\". The cabinet itself is 17\" tall. What about cups or other dishes that are dishwasher safe for top rack only? Has anyone tried washing them in this machine? \\'Top rack only\\' applies to dishwashers with a drying cycle heating coil, as the coil will melt or disfigure those items. This dishwasher doesn\\'t have a heating coil. Instead it dries items by heating up the water to around 160 degrees while rinsing so everything gets really hot; then drains the water; then the items (mostly) evaporate the water off because they are so hot. Plastic-ware will not melt at this temperature so your \\'top rack\\' items can be put in there like all other items.. Can this machine be attached to a garden hose? Yes. How much does it weigh? The box weighed about 50 pounds when the unit was delivered. If I subtract the weight of the packaging, my best estimate is the dishwasher weighs between 42 and 45 pounds.. Why is washer only washer for a few seconds Not sure mine works great is the water connected and flowing to the unit? Try changing the selector knob and trying it again good luck. Where is the koldfront dishwasher made? Made in China, according to the specs sticker on the back of my unit.. How long does it take to run a load of dishes? This is all according to the manual: The heaviest mode is 100 minutes (1:40), the normal mode, which is what I run on, is 85 minutes, just under an hour and a half. Light is 75 minutes. Glassware mode is 70, and speed mode, which does not dry, is 45 minutes. The faucet adapter does not fit. Anyone know how I\\'m supposed to know what size I should get? Nowhere in the manual does it say what size this one is. I struggled with this too until I realized the adapter is in the nozzle attachment.. ',\n",
       " \"Is it possible to install the water and waste lines directly under the sink That's how I hooked ours up, I drilled a hole through the countertop behind the unit, underneath spliced into hot water line and the sink drain. Works perfect.. Are you supposed to leave the water running the entire cycle or is there a point where you turn it off? If not this might run up my water bill :/ Yes...However, it really doesn't use alot of water. Although the faucet is turned on the entire time, the dishwasher only pulls water from it at certain times. So the water is not running into the dishwasher the whole time. ...Hope that helps.. how do you hook these portable dishwasher up and how do they drain? There is a hose (it's actually 2 in 1) coming from the back of the unit that attaches to your faucet. The faucet remains on throughout the cycle and the unit controls the flow of water. From that same hose it drains into the sink. The hose isn't very long so you will want to make sure you have space and an outlet within a few feet of the sink.. How long is the DRAIN hose? My cabinets are too low to place the item right next to my sink. Approximately 5 feet also note that the supply and drain hose are connected together on the sink adapter and are attached on the back of the unit looking from the front on the right side. So if placed to left of sink you would have full length of hose if placed to right about 3 feet. Hope this helps. Can you wash cups or other dishes that are dishwasher safe for top rack only? Has anyone tried washing them in this machine? Yes. It cleans everything that goes in a normal dishwasher. It also has a setting for light/china, and soak.. How long are the wash setting times? The one we typically use is about an hour and a half (includes heated drying time).. Does it use the same amount of dish detergent as the largerdishwashers? Can you use the dish detergent pods? I would have to say it uses about as much as a larger dishwasher. I think that the pods would probably work if their liquid pods The pods that get hard might not work in there. Why does my dishwasher leak from underneath? Can I fix it myself or do I have to return it? If u are using rinse aid, stop using and run couple of cycles without. Rinse aid causes these dishwashers to have too many suds when mixed with the detergent, thereby causing leaks. Those dishwasher tablets work best for these small washers. The tabs contain a small oamount of Rinse aid. Whenever I fill the built-in reservoir with Rinse Aid mine too oozes out. Once I stopped using rinse aid, the issue stopped. Try that if it still leaks then return, try running and dont add soap until the rinse aid dissappears. Then use tabs once Rinse Aid is gone, this works for me.. is it suitable for a family of 5? It works great for just the two of us. I don't think it's heavy duty enough for a family of five. You would have to run it constantly for that many dishes.. Can I see more pictures? Yes, we have 5 other pictures which are not currently being displayed, these should be uploaded shortly.. \",\n",

       " 'Can I use cast iron fry pan 11 inches for my nesco induction cooktop 1500 watts Cast iron is not an issue, but I found that size is. Larger size pots make the unit heat up and trigger an automatic shut off. The manual that came with it reads \"Use cookware that is flat, suitable for induction heating and having a bottom diameter between 3.15 inches and 10.00 inches.\". what is the largest quart pot can you use The induction surface is 10 inches in diameter. Any pot that has a bottom that size or less will work. Our stock pot is 8 quarts and it works very well.. Is it cool to the touch with your hand when it\\'s on? I saw something like that on tv. Is this the same type of item? It is cool. But it will not turn on until it senses iron, steel. It will not turn on with copper, aluminum, glass, ceramic, and some stainless. When it senses the right magnetic material, it induces magnetic energy into the metal. When it does that the surface of the PIC does not get hot on it\\'s own. The cookware gets hot very fast! When the cookware gets hot it will transfer heat to the surface of the PIC. This model has only 5 heat settings. I am completely satisfied. The units on TV are more sophisticated and more expensive. This Nesco is 1500 watts. I have tested this Nesco and it does not proportion the energy at its lower settings (like a microwave in defrost mode). Some do and can cause burning. Some more expensive I have seen are 1800 watts. This Nesco is a practical start to get to know what induction cooking is about. Experiment with what kinds of cookware is right for you. At a later time you can add another one or two. This could be the next cooking revolution since the microwave. Have fun exploring and cooking..

For example, the med. high button shows 375 degree temp. but you can change that to any temp. you want by simply pushing the up, down button. I\\'ve only had the Nesco less than a week. I purchased it for when I cook for special occasions, but find I have cooked with it every day. Both are very good cooktops, one has all the bells and whistles and the other cooks just as well. By the way, the NuWaves cost me right under $210.00 delivered.. Is this cooktop truly portable, as in taking it camping or on a picnic where there are no outlets to plug in appliances? This cooktop is an electric appliance and doesn\\'t work unless it is plugged into an electric outlet. It is portable because it is small enough to carry from place to place.. Can it work with 220 and 120 ? The \"name plate\" on the bottom specifies 1500W at 120 volts. In my opinion it will be destroyed at 220 volts as well as attempting to operate it on direct current. AC only. hope this helps.. Can I use non stick pan if it had the magnet on the bottom to use on this cooktop? Yes. Does this come with a carrying case?

I'd say at least a year. It depends on how much water you push thru it.. Does it fit Kitchen Aid model # KFCS22EBMS8 Sorry, KA customer care might know.. Does it fit Kitchen Aid model # KFCS22EBMS8 Hello Ms. R., I cannot answer your question. The only suggestion I may make is to type in your model number and allow Amazon to determined which filter is correct. That process is what I did.. Do these filters go in the bottom grill or in the refrigerator? We have a side by side. My refrigerator. Do these filters go in the bottom grill or in the refrigerator? We have a side by side. in the right hand side of the fridge. very easy. Do these filters work on thermador refrigerator? Sorry can,t help we have a may tag French door. is this price for 1 filter or 3 I purchased for this all 3 filters. Put 2 away for later use. It comes with a sticker to label the filter you put in the fridge so you remember when you replaced. Very great value for my purchase. 100% happy.. \",\n",

Another thing is, this is the third time I have bought one of these burners; my stove has what is called high speed and standard burners. I want the standard but I keep receiving the high speed. I continue to buy these things because I live in the Republic of Panama and they are hard to find.. will this fit my Maytag model CRG9700CAW Yes this will fit.these come in colors so if black is what you want then ok.there are some aftermarket burners that are cheaper and will work they just don't lock into the opening they just sit there but they will save you money.. will this fit my Magic Chef range model# cgr3742cdc Yes. what color is it? black.

       " 'What is the installed depth of this machine? Is it really just 29.75\", or do I need to allot more space to install this washer? No the installation depth is 30.25\" The measurement around the base where it touches the floor is what is listed with the machines. They don\\'t measure the circumference of the machine at the middle with the doors and stuff that sticks out for installation is the back we measured 30.25\". Plus you need to take into account the door must stand open at least an hour after use for proper drying to prevent mold in the machine. I love my machine but the fit is tight and the door being open in to our hallway can be a problem. I\\'ve learned something else the LG needs to be drained at least once every few weeks depending on use. There is an additional drain in the machine that collects the little trickle of water wrung out in the spin cycle. This drain is very difficult to use if the machine is setting on the floor. I would recommend buying the storage drawers that the machine set on if you are not stacking this on a dryer. Go for it.. Is this 110 or 220 volt machine? This one is 110V But I\\'m sure you can request a 220v if you wish as I\\'m told its cheaper on your bill. DOES machine use HE detergent? Yes. Exclusively. You\\'re not supposed to use any other kind with that machine.. Where do I find spin only cycle on LG steam 11kg washing machine? with the machine on, but no cycle selected try pressing the spin button. On mine that sets up 14 mins of spin. You can then choose how hard to spin and hit start.. How long is a normal wash cycle? normal wash is 49 minutes. is there a matching dryer for this washer I believe there is (although I didn\\'t need a new dryer). LG\\'s washing machines seem to start with WM, and their dryers start with DLE. So DLE2650 would be the mate to this washing machine.. ',\n",
       " 'can someone clarify which symbols go with which wash cycle? the manuak seriously needs a rewrite. My manual was clear: 12 o\\'clock position, INTENSIVE (STRONG). 2 o\\'clock, NORMAL. 4 o\\'clock, ECONOMY. 6 o\\'clock, RINSE. 8 o\\'clock, RAPID WASH. 10 o\\'clock, SOAK.. does this machine come with everything needed to hook up to the water source? yes, hose which is stored in back nicely when not in use. an adapter for your faucet although I had to buy a second rubber washer so that it didn\\'t leak when the dw was on. It also comes with a white funnel for the salt aid. In my long review I had said the salt aid light stayed on even after I used the machine, but it has since turned off... maybe it just needed time to \\'soak in\\' but it works well now. Plug is long, also stored in back. The only thing you really need to buy is dishwasher detergent and a rinse aid (I use Jetdry) for the slots inside, and the salt aid which is put through the funnel on the inside. Found it hard to find, $25 some places but finally found 2 pound bag for $8 on amazon by whirlpool. Says it can take up to four pounds but I just used the 2 to see if it worked. So far so good. very happy with it, very very quiet, easy to roll around.. Does the shipping package say what is in the box? Or is it a nondescript Amazon box? It comes in a Danby box with a picture of the appliance on the outside.. Some water has collected in the bottom of the dishwasher. How can I drain that water before carrying it downstairs? The easiest way is to turn on the dishwasher and start a cycle which will let the water out before it starts a new cycle, then turn it off. According to the manual, a small amount of water collecting at the bottom of the dishwasher is normal, but if it seems like too much, this would probably be the best way. The other way might be to remove the lower shelf and let a towel sop it up, but my first recommendation would likely be simpler.. How do I know if my faucet is compatible with the unit? I live in an apartment where I cannot replace the faucet. If you have a standard faucet with an aerator that unscrews or a faucet with screw threads on it. What does not work is the faucet head that pulls out and becomes a sprayer. If you have a doubt you can order a faucet adapter for $7.99. Just type \"Danby faucet adaptor\" in Amazon search.. can it be installed easily or do I need to call a plumber? No need to call a plumber- you just hook it up (easily) to your faucet when you want to use it, and then unhook it when it\\'s done.. How long is the hose connecting this to the sink/how far from the sink can the dishwasher be? The hose is pretty short ( about 3-4 ft) but is easy to detach and reattach to move. It\\'s on wheels and moving it is simple. Mine has to sit directly in front of the sink. You can also buy longer hoses for it.. Need quick response! If the hose doesn\\'t reach is their a way to expand it??? TIA! Not that I know of. We have to wheel our washer pretty close to the sink, I wish the hose was a bit longer too.. is there a gentle cycle? I copied and pasted the section from the operators manual that describes each wash setting. Hope this will help. The setting on the machine that has the stemware symbol corresponds to Rapid Wash in the Operators Manual. A bit confusing perhaps. I routinely put items in my Danby that friends with full size dishwashers are afraid to put in theirs, and I\\'ve never had any issues. I think the key for delicate items is loading the dishwasher so dishes can\\'t bang around RAPID WASH Glassware: For lightly soiled loads, such as glasses, crystal and fine china. is it possible to take the wheels off? if so how high is it without wheels? I suppose you could remove the wheels, but then it would be 2-3 inches lower than a standard countertop. The hose is only about 3\\' long and must drain into the sink or a pipe, with the faucet directly above it. It only fits over a typical kitchen or bathroom style faucet, not a threaded one like for washing machines. They do make a version for permanent installation. I recommend buying from Walmart in case you need to return it for any reason.. ',\n",
       " \"I have a Millers rubberized 7.5gal. keg. Will it fit? It should fit if you use the round keg shelf that came with the kegerator. I use 1/4 kegs in mine and with the shelf they fit perfect.. Is there a extension piece that I can get to raise the tape head base off the fridge? (so I can mount the tap head base on a counter top) You might be careful with that. This cooler needs fresh air and not enclosed within a cabinet. You will also require some kind of blower to keep the beer line cold on your extension, otherwise your first couple of beers after it sits will be primarely foam.. Can this unit be converted to dispense wine and how to convert? I DID NOT BUY THIS UNIT. can this be installed under-counter and does it cool properly if installed under-counter? I installed this under an outdoor kitchen outside in Jacksonville Florida did not receive any complaints so it must be working well. How cold does this get? I need close to 34*F You can get it below freezing if you want. There is no temperature gauge, so you need to put a thermometer inside and inside and play with it a little, but it will get as cold as you want.. What is the actual height of the fridge unit (minus the rack and the wheel space) Will get back to u on this one. Can the steel rack be taken off and the tower removed and mounted on top of an outdoor counter. I realize I will have to insulate the hole in the top My Son-in law did that and it works fine. The distance (tubing) to the tap need to be short to keep it cool.. Good morning, if i buy the Keg Cooler , do i need any aditional accesory so i can use it, thank you It comes with a CO2 tank but it will need to be filled with CO2. Also another good thing to get but not necessary is a kegerator cleaning kit. Other than that your good to go!. Would two 1/6 kegs fit in here? I know I would have to buy a dual tap. yes. Will the CO2 tank fit in the kegerator with a 1/2 barrel keg (15.5 gal)? The tank sits outside of the kegerator, so you can hook up any size tank you'd like, The line runs through and air tight hole out of the back. There's a tank holder that attaches to the back, but i think it only holds up to a 5gal tank.. \",\n",

       " 'Is it quiet? As compared to others yes, but any fan creates sound when moving air through the filters. All in all very satisfied with performance of this product.. This fan mentions that is adjustable for height. Can you slide this up when not need and then back down when desired? No, it is adjustable during installation only to get you proper height from the fan to the stove top for proper draft.. does this come with a cap for when the duct comes though the outside wall? No it does not. Is this company, EUREKA, related the vacuum cleaner maker? I don\\'t know but I will tell you that the quality of this hood is great, we have had it installed for quite awhile and not a single problem.I would highly recommend this hood.. Is the 30\" range hood OK for a 30\" gas range, or is it recommended that the hood be wider than the range? (i.e. a 36\" hood?) I think a 30 over 30 is fine. I\\'ve been renovation homes for 15 years and see no problem with that. Coincidentally though just last night I noticed the plastic tabs to remove the two screens have melted. This could be because I installed the hood over a commercial grade range in my home. I don\\'t know, but I\\'ll need to now have those parts replaced. The fan is quiet and that\\'s a plus.. I have a 7ft 8in ceiling. Will this range hood work for that? Also, we don\\'t want the hood the hand more than 24 inches from the ceiling. my ceiling is only 8 ft and the hood works fine. There is a standard height above the oven that is a code. I am not sure of the exact distance, but I know my setting on the fan meets that code. The fan adjusts with two stainless steel sleeves that allow you to set the distance within a range. Again, I do not have those measurements in front of me, but this fans works in a kitchen with an 8 ft ceiling. Hope this helps.. What is db level? Decibel level, it\\'s the amount of noise the fan creates while running. I have this particular fan and it isn\\'t very loud on low or medium but while on high it can be noisy. I\\'m ok with this though because you will be hard pressed to find a 900 cfm fan that isn\\'t, especially for this price.. What is the minimum length you can make this chimney? I need it to be no longer than 26\" Just measured; 24\" would be the absolute minimum. As to the unit, I would highly recomend this as a quiet, efficient, good looking unit. Is this unit for ductless ventilation. Very happy with this product. My is vented thru the roof. I strongly suggest this setup. Is an extension available for a 10\\' ceiling? If so, how much? I dont think so. At full extension mine only reaches 45 -50 down from the roof. ',\n",

Will this part work for a Frigidaire washer Model# FCCW3000FS ? Hello Nora: I purchased this product a month ago and would NOT recommend anyone else purchase it. First, it does not come with the coin reservoir in the photo (the steal bottom). Second, you would need a timer or way to tie into the power source. I had a professional electrician and he bought a specialist who works on slot machines in Las Vegas to try to install. They tell me it\\'s impossible or would cost more to engineer than the washer is worth. I could not get any straight answers when I made the purchase if it would work on my machine, so I look at it as a $90 learning opportunity. I would recommend just buying a coin-operated washing machine. I have found Home Depot to have the best pricing available. Be careful when shopping online, I have found some \"great deals\" on coin op washer and dryers on websites like Best Buy, but when you read the fine print the machine does not come with the coin op shown in the photo.. can it be place on a ge coin operated electri dryer model DCCB330EJWC Yes it can. That what I use it on. Is this used to replace and existing coin-operated box or can it be installed to convert a non-coin-operated washer and/or dryer? Big job doing so?

Paula, I have never before heard this issue raised, but I appreciate the information. If that spot is scratch-prone, we can let future customers know to be mindful of this and take extra precaution. Thanks so much. Sincerely, JR Hill Goedekers.com. We have the UE error (out of warranty) constantly - who is best to fix? Someone from LG? Unfortunately, this is an inherent design flaw. There is no \"fix\", software updates often make it worse. There are a couple of work-arounds: For small loads (these make it go out of balance a lot) try \"baby wear\", otherwise the larger the load the less likely you will get UE code. Remember, if you see the Capital \"UE\" vs. the lower case ue, it means that the machine has filled with water and emptied several times trying to even out the load, wasted huge amounts of water, and then just shut off. I recommend giving to charity and taking a tax write off.. WATER LEAKS We had a problem initially with water overflowing from the drain hose, but we extended the pipe with another pipe so it would extend deep into the drain pipe (6+ inches) and then clamped a rubber sleeve around the joined area. It works like a charm now.. Is anyone having a problem with water temperature? Our machine only gets lukewarm even on the hot setting. Sensors replaced no help. Is the hot water supply to the washer actually hot? Is there a long run of pipe to the water heater (water that has to be used up before the hot water appears)? Is the wash water hotter if you shut off the cold supply temporarily as a test? Do you have an on-demand water heater that maybe can\\'t keep up? By the way, it seems like for the WARM water setting, this washer does not mix hot and cold to produce a specific target temperature. It just turns both on and you get what you get. It\\'s up to you to adjust the valves of the supply (usually closing the cold valve slightly) to achieve the right temperature water for WARM.. has anyone else had problems with the glass lid on the top loader We have had this washer for the last two months and have had no issues with the glass lid.

What is the decibel level of the vent? The Cavaliere-Euro AP238-PS29-30 model claims 43dB to 68dB. As a former Chief Engineer for the USN I became of DBs and the impact on hearing. We have had this Unit for over a month and even and 900 CFM the DB level is reasonable. At the lower settings, 1-4 it is quiet and below the average for a comparable Unit. I do recommend it. By the way, in a closed environment (Central Air) I recommend cracking a window kitchen to allow the unit to remove air from the kitchen.. it says the lights are dimmable but one review said they were not. Do they dim? They do, but you have to hold the button for a few seconds and then it changes intensity on it\\'s own. You let up when you get the desired brightness. The rear lights are great. They light up the back half that is in the shadow from room lights. Enjoy.. Does the finish match or look close to the Frigidaire Gallery Stainless Appliances? very close.. Has anyone purchased and installed this as recirculating, and if so, how well has it functioned? Do you have to buy separate filters for it? The blower\\'s very strong, and it\\'ll blow grease all over the kitchen. Filters are the same, but vendor might sell a charcoal filter.. Is the duct round? square? what the parameters? 6\" round. does this come with a duct cover For the outside? No. I had to get one from a local hardware store.. ',\n",
       " 'This unit has a smoke sensor. How sensitive is it? How long does it take to activate the hood? Can it sense steam if you boil water? I find it too sensitive and it would randomly come on so I dont use the auto setting. I also had to put a dot over the remote sensor as it was the same as the tv and everytime we turned on the tv the hood would come on. I do love it but one other thing is the.bulbs are not replacable and are not very bright. It is very efficient though and clears out smoke and steam quickly even on low speeds. Easy to clean also. .. is it easy to install I wouldn\\'t call it easy, it take quite a bit of know how to run the vents, secure it to the cabinet, and cut the holes in the cabinets. It\\'s also very heavy but the hood is well worth it. It works great!. Is this available in a back vent instead of top vent exhaust? Hello Arnie, Unfortunately we only have the exhaust vent coming out of the top and not out of the back of any of our models. Thank you, Range Hood Direct Buy. can I reduce the 8\\' VENT OUTLET To 5\" existing duct If you can find an adapter, you can. It may not be a good idea to shrink the size of vent since this is a powerful vent and the matched vent pipe size will fully take its max vent function. 5\" vent size is kind of too small, but you can if you have no other choice.. I live in Atlanta. Who do you recommend to install? We need it to vent out and will have to punch through brick exterior walls. Yes, we are pretty happy with it. The switch controls works by hovering the fingers on it, not by press. It is doing a great job for us. How is this different from UL10-U30 model? All I want is a hood with real 900 CFM (or at least close to it). thanks. Based on my research before purchasing, the difference between these 2 units, per the XtremeAir website, is that the PX10-U30 features \"4-speed screen touch sensitive electronic control w/ blue LED display; programmable 1-15 minute delayed power auto shut off; and remote control.\" The UL10-U30 has \"3-speed mechanical EZ push buttons\"; no touch display, no delayed auto shut off and no remote control. the PX also offers sensor operation, and I don\\'t see that listed among the features of the UL. Bells and whistles in terms of the controls is the primary difference as far as I can tell. As to whether it\\'s a \"true 900CFM\", I can\\'t tell you for certain, but I can tell you that I\\'ve been extremely happy with the suction and smoke evacuation from this unit, not to mention the quietness. Installation was a bit of a bear, and definitely not one-man job. It\\'s not overly \"complicated\", just that the unit is heavy and cumbersome and you definitely need to be methodical. But, if you take your time, go step-by-step (and have some help), I think you\\'ll be as happy with the unit as I am. Hope that helps.. Can someone let me know how far the vent is located from the back? Thanks. I can\\'t really tell anymore because it\\'s install and you can\\'t see. If I had to guess, I would say about 2 or 3 inches. It is a great vent though.. What is the warranty for this product? The product PX10-U30 has a Ten-years Motor Limited Factory Warranty but this is only through the manufacturer of the product, Xtreme Air USA..

       " 'Does this filter out chlorine and chloramine? I based my selection of this filter on the lab report linked here \"http://crystalquest.com/Water%20test%20Multi-Stage.pdf\" I am not a chemist and have not tested the water since attaching this filter to our ice maker. Understand that the report does not indicate from what model number the water was tested and that this test is from the Crystal Quest website. To be more specific as to answering your question---if chlorine is chloride \"http://www.nutriology.com/chloride.php\" then, yes, it is filtered out but not 100%. As for chloramine \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloramine\"---the report lists different Dichlora*, Chlora* and Trichlora* compounds that are filtered out. On a personal level, the ice looks better and tastes better. I also noticed the cubes completely freeze now whereas, before the filter, the ice was not. I have not adjusted the freezer tempurature or ice timing.. What size water line does this filter accommodate? Thank you. 1/4\" plastic tubing into the filter. The t-joint to tap into the line is 1/2\" i believe. How long does this filter last? 3 years, 5 years? Can\\'t find the info here. Thanks. We change ours once a year. Not sure if that is what is recommended though.... At what minimal height do we actually need to install this filter, to allow for clearance to change the cartridge?? We\\'d like it under the sink. Fully assembled it is about 15 inches, you\\'ll need another 10 inches to install the filter. I have mine installed as an external filter for the refrigerator water & ice, so I don\\'t have a space issue. I measured under my sink and I have a good 25 inches in height on the inside. I\\'m sure if I had a drinking spout faucet I could install it under there without issue. Make sure you have a good 10 inches from the mounting surface to allow room for the special wrench to fit over the casing too. G\\'Luck!.

If you don\\'t overfill with clothing, you can\\'t stuff the machines like in the old washers, it works reasonably well .. can I wash a twin bedspread quilted I say that you can... I\\'ve washed a twin comforter in mine with no problem. It pretty well filled the tub and that\\'s all I washed in that load. Please note that if the washer is the least bit out of level, it will wobble and even \"walk\" across the floor. This is a pretty heavy load and the spin cycle is a speedy 700 revolutions per minute. Also be sure to use HE detergent and maybe just a wee bit more than usual.. reviews on high efficiency washers vs regular washers this machine does an excelleny job. I was told that the real expensive front load machines suffer from drum odors because you can not leave the door open when not in use. You get high effiency from this machine and no issues.

Hmmm - never had that problem, although my drain tube is a little lower...about 2ft 9inch.. Does this machine require alot of repair? No. Washer water level does not cover a large comforter that is set to \"super\" water level. Can I add water on my own? Yes, water can be added manually. Just watch closely and don\\'t overfill or you\\'ll have water on the floor.. How do you get a short wash cycle? It seems the speed cycle takes 50 minutes for a few towels. If you are using the towels and sheets cycle it uses a soak cycle. Try a different setting.. What brand is this reviewing? This is a GE piece;.

All measurements made by me using a Stanley tape measure and a Mark I eyeball.. Will this work for those really hard-to-dry pesky water bottles and lids? If so, it would be worth it\\'s weight in gold... I do find my water bottles drying out faster ;). How easy is it to clean? It occasionally gets gunky. If it\\'s light, I just spray with a cleaner (I use white vinegar), let it sit for a minute, then rinse off.

Do you mean the distance between the fingers?. What is the color of the rack? It doesn\\' mention the color. White - it looks just like the picture.. Are the fingers removable?

I use it for bottles and pump parts - wish I had it months ago!. How many pegs does it have and are they coated with a non-slip substance such as silicone or rubber? Thank you The pegs are in a 7 by 8 array, for a total of 56. The ends of the pegs are coated with plastic, a different kind of plastic than the body of the rack; it is slightly less slippery than the body of the rack but I would not call it non-slip. The coating flares out a little, kind of like an elongated matchstick, and this flare provides a bit of mechanical grip on plates. I have never had anything slip off or out of the pegs. I highly recommend this rack.. I was thinking about using this as an in-sink dish rack. Is the material something I could drill holes into for drainage? It is made of a stiff plastic, so you could probably drill holes in the bottom.. ',\n",

If you don\\'t use the extra rinse does the machine stop after it is finished right before the extra rinse on the dial? Yes, that is correct.. Hot water wash is great, but does it also offer a cold water wash? It offers hot, warm, and YES cold.. Is this an electric or gas washer? It\\'s electric and a wonderful washer. Does the washer fill for the extra rinse or just spritz some water? It fills back up for the rinse cycle, so clothes are actually rinsed out. This washer uses water to wash clothes versus the HE models that use \"tumbling and movement\". That\\'s why clothes are so much cleaner. The HE model that I had really was not as energy efficient as it claimed to be because with the self balancing making the cycles long and when the machine was not in use, the lights and the computer system was still on, the only way to make it not \"ghost\" electricity was to unplug it after each use. I so love this simple machine, wish I had purchased it sooner.. Does the Speed Queen 432 have a buzzer to indicate that the wash cycle is done?

I have used both liquid and powder homemade laundry soap. We haven\\'t had any problems at all, although we have only had the washer for a few months. I think if you have a low sudsing formula and use an appropriate amount, you would be fine (just like any other detergent.....you don\\'t need much).

What washer pan can fit this washing machine? Just go 2 inches wider than the base dimensions. I want to know how long it actually takes to wash a typical load of laundry. 40 mins? 60 mins?

This isn\\'t an answer to the question, but rather a repeat of the question and a response to the previous \"answers.\" Mr/Ms Roby, if you don\\'t understand the question, why did you write an answer? Ms Cowgirl, the Product Description says, \"This amazing instant water heater can be connected to the existing hot water piping.\" So perhaps a better explanation is that YOU cannot hook it up to American piping. If NO ONE could hook it up to American piping, it wouldn\\'t have a 4.4-star rating. Mr Curcie, what difference does it make WHY Ms O\\'Meara wants it hotter? A shower is not the only way people use hot water. Folks running a food truck, for instance, might need hot water over 100 to make hot tea, instant coffee, wash their utensils, etc. Using the example in the Product Description, tap water coming in at 56 will be heated 45 to 101. This is NOT hot enough for hot drinks, as 101 is only 2.4 above body temperature. Great for baby formula; not great for coffee. If the 101 water from one unit can be run through a second unit, a 45 temperature rise will yield 146 water, which IS hot enough for coffee and hot tea.

I just installed one in my rv but I found that I had to install it in the basement where there was enough clearance on the top. The exhaust on the top of the excel gets way too hot, so I felt it would be better where there was plenty of room around it so nothing would melt or burn. I love it though. I can happily take a 45 minute shower if I want.. I just installed heater works but starting water temp is only 46 deg. (Cold) And I can\\'t seem to get water heater to 100 Degrees. Any suggestions? You will have to turn the volume of water down. Install a gate valve before the heater and turn it half closed. These are great little units but if the incoming temperature is low they don\\'t have enough btu\\'s to raise the temp that much. Hope this helps.. What fits the connections?

Has anyone had a problem with the water going cold and having to shut off the water and restart? I had an older Excel and it had that issue. I had mine mounted outside and found the wind would blow it out. I mounted it inside under my kitchen sink and it works flawlessly.. I wish to know if this or any variant of the 1.6gpm Excel Water Heater works with LPG Campingaz (Butane) ? Your kind help appreciated, Nick Wells No. i hook up my tankless water heater it go on for 1min then shuts off. and no hot water. can you help When u turn on the hot water at the faucet, do u turn on just the hot? Because my heater turns off the moment I turn on the cold water. I think it must have something to do with the amount of pressure the water is coming in and out of the water heater. It has to be at a minimal pressure or the heater will not operate properly. When I turn on my cold water to mix with the hot, I guess it reduces how much pressure I\\'m pulling from the heater so it turns off. Although when I\\'m taking a shower, my shower head allows for a higher gpm (gallon per minute), so I can have both the hot and cold water running at the same time in my shower only.. Do you use a 1/2\" flare connection to connect the propane or a female pipe thread or npt? Or other?

       " \"What is the difference between this and model 10140917? Thank you Obviously, the big difference is the price. However, in my research I found the parts that attach to your machine may be slightly different with different part numbers. Therefore, it will not fit your machine hook ups or plug in parts, thus creating a leak or bad electrical connection. To be sure what part # is correct check the part number and match to the part number you are replacing. If there are no numbers on part you want to replace, look at the specific model and make of your machine and match that way. Each manufacturer has specific # on their parts for each model of machine they sell. Descriptions also in listing with part stating what machine or model they go with. Numbers could also be engraved on original part too. If you still aren't 100% sure it's the correct part for your machine, call the 800# for the manufacturer of your machine. They can generally give you help with part numbers. In closing, if you do order the wrong part, Amazon is very good about returns and replacements.

You can reset the light by pressing and holding the Alarm button at the bottom left of the display for 3 secs. Then you may decide when you would change it.

Only ones that have had any problem are the ones that are short and come up to the bottom of the sensor. Regarding stock pots, you would have to hold the pot in place and most likely, the \"unstable container\" warning would stop it on Autofill. However, holding it in place with slight pressure against the back of the sensor will fill it like regular fill function.

We used to use Pur water filters as well before we purchased our new fridge. I used to love that i couldnt TASTE the water with the Pur filters :-) I can honestly say the electrolux filters are comparable and we have been using them for about 2 years now.. 1) Heard about bad smell in filtered water; also, (2) about difficulty in installing the replacement filter; (3) is changing every 6 months necessary 1. I have not experienced bad smell in filtered water. 2. It was easy enough for me to install or replace a new filter. 3. Replace the filter only when the light turns red, otherwise you are wasting money.. ',\n",

Is this for three OEM filters, or for three off brand replacements? By not answering They answered it. No. \",\n",
       " 'Is there installation along with shipping? or it just ships to you and everything else is done on your own? No - you have to install them yourself. You get four big boxes - (2) pedestals, washer, dryer. I think it may be an option to have the units actually delivered inside, but I can\\'t remember. Either way, two strong people should be able to move all four, although the washer is considerably heavier than the dryer. I suggest leaving them in the boxes until you get them to the final spot as it makes them easier to move. Installation itself is not all that complicated. Just follow the instructions and you\\'ll be alright. Also - the dryer ships without an electrical cord. Be sure to get the right one that fits your specific outlet. Overall, my experience with the whole ordering and installation process was good. I like the washer and dryer too.. we just purchased this washer and dryer set, and just unpacked the dryer today. but no power cable and no duck hose? is this right?there should be at least the power calble, right? It does not come with the power cord. Look at your power receptical in the wall and carefully note number of prongs and configuration(maybe take a picture with your phone). Then go to Home Depot and get the right power cord.

You can do this with one hand after a few tries.. Does this unit have to be used with a booster fan I have mine without and It has worked flawless. It would seem depending on the distance to the out side. My vent is through the wall directly behind my dryer.. Is there a way for this to blow HOT air into are house during winter months for are electric dryer? I was thinking about energy efficiency. I would ask a home contractor about that. I believe that it would have to vent outside the home to meet building code. Although, I do see your point!. I plan to mount this unit outside on the brick wall. OK? Yes. What size is the duct? Is it 4\"? Yes 4\". Does it require water? no. Has anyone replaced the little screen? Where did you obtain? I have not had to but when I order the glass was cracked. I called and they replaced it no questions asked. I would call the company. May send you a new one no charge.. does this go inline of vent? does the heat and moisture come into the home? No if you have a vent door on the out side of the house, it opens when you use your dryer, closes to keep rain, heat, bugs, small creators, out of the house. Yes the vent trap goes in the dryer vent line near the dryer so you can clean it.. Can this be used with a gas dryer? Unless you have flames shooting out the back of your dryer, I don\\'t believe the type of dryer is a problem.. Could this be used in the garage? Dryer vents into garage and cannot find anything to truly catch lint. Garage ends up being a mess. It would certainly catch the lint, but I don\\'t know how legal the installation would be.. ',\n",

My sister has the same refrigerator and has had it fixed four or five times. There was a class action suit against LG for this refrigerator.

Saw floor model &amp; when I closed left door, right popped open &amp; vice versa. No, overall it\\'s a good refrigerator. I\\'d like to know from those who rated this fridge over a year ago how it is holding up. Would you buy this again? We definitely would, no doubt about it. I\\'m still absolutely amazed at how big this fridge is. It\\'s only downfall is it makes ice a bit slower than some others. This is because the whole unit is in the door, so it likely doesn\\'t freeze water as fast. The ends justify the means though. It still makes ice plenty fast for my family of 4, who use a ton of ice living in AZ in the summertime heat. It just doesn\\'t make it quite fast enough to always have enough ice for our weekend sports for the kids (filling up the small cooler), like our previous fridge was able to keep up with. No biggie though for most people buying this, but figured I\\'d point this out in case it is a concern for you.. Can this refrigerator be ordered in Bisque? Sorry No, They don\\'t make it in Bisque. Does the refrigerator come with a waterline or do you have to buy that extra? My refrigerator did not come with a wateline. How often do you have to replace the water filter? What model filter is it?

You can just go to lowes and they can look it up also-- it is VERY $$$ Yes, it comes with a bypass attachment (beware, mine was supposed to have a new replacement filter, but didn\\'t). Is this Energy Star qualified? Yes. Its got a big Energy Star Sticker and I\\'ve noticed a decrease in my electrical bill in the 9 months its been operational.. Did this refrigerator come with the gray plastic kick plate that attaches to the front bottom of the refrigerator? Mine did not. No, these don\\'t come with front kick plates. With the slide out freezer box being so close to the floor, there is no clearance for a kick plate.. This item has a smaller ice maker. Does it make ice quickly? Is the ice always empty after use?

I don\\'t remember it saying from Whirlpool, but it has worked good ever since. I just assume most things are from China anymore.. What is the dimension, because the description looks totally wrong. I know the one that it replaces is only about an inch thick but when replacing mine found that there was an adapter plate over the hole that holds this size motor so the cheap flat one would fit. I had no problem putting this one in at all.. why does this show a blade if it does not come with the motor? Because the people putting together Amazon product listings make mistakes every once in a while. The important thing is this: if you are replacing the existing motor in your fridge you already have the blades you need attached to the old motor, and it is easy to move the blades from the old motor to the new one.. so this one turns the blades in the wrong direction? it turn counter clockwise. which makes it blow toward the water tray and away from the compressor If you reverse the two wires it will spin in the opposite direction. I also think the blade can be flipped if necessary. I\\'m real sure it will work for you.. Does this include the blades? no. The description of this motor states it is .5\" x 1\" x 1.37\".

It can also work independently using just the recycling timer. Can this unit display the actual real time temperature and humidity in the space? Yes it gives a constant real time update on temp and humidity. Mine is 1 year old working great!. Does this unit have a CO2 ppm detector? It does not. However they do have a controller that does. Its about twice the price but worth it.. will this allow you to set a low temp. setting to turn fans off and a hight temp setting to turn fans on? Yes it will.. What if you need to incorporate a heater? It seems the temperature control is for only turning a cooling device on, am I missing something? The device has 4 plugs and they are labeled,1.\"cooling output\", 2.\"night Output\", 3.\"CO2 output\" 4.\"humidity output\". The \"cooling output \" plug has temperature settings that can be set,independently, for day and night and will control your a/c and/or fans (or ANY device that cools).dead band is adjustable.The cooling device does NOT need to have its own thermostat,but its better if it does ,if its an a/c or high power draw device. Just make absolutely sure you factor in the start up watts for the device and never exceed the rating.a good rule is to never go above 80% of the maximum.factor for the largest POSSIBLE load. The \"night output\" plug is always on at night(off during the day) and you can plug a heater in there but you would still need the heater to have its own thermostat,as the night output plug is always on at night. The \"CO2 output\" plug is a DAY recycle timer and controls whatever device you have plugged and cycle the power cycle on and off based on the \"on time\" and \"off time\" set.This timer is OFF during night. CO2 isnt used in high enough amounts to have on at night. The \"humidity output\" plug cycles whatever device you have plugged in based on the humidity settings. you can have seperate day and night humidity settings and you can select \"humidity increase\" or \"humidity decrease\" modes.one to humidify and one to de humidify. Dead band is adjustable. it also has a temp/humidity lock that lets you use fans to cool and remove humidity instead of the a/c.or split mode for using and a/c to cool and fans/dehumidifier to remove moisture. split mode allows independent control. you can also set it to turn off the co2 when the fans run.. If this item does not have a CO2 detector, can you set the time for CO2 production and the CO2 production cycle? The Autopilot Digital Environmental Controller (DEC) precisely controls temperature and humidity within your grow area. The DEC coordinates the use of supplemental CO2 injection within the temperature function. The DEC has four outlets and a 15\\' remote combination probe with highly accurate temperature, humidity and light sensors.

       " \"Any information available on how to set up Evolve LTM-5 as a remote switch? (to control remotely another z-wave switch that operates a light)? You will have to do it in your controller. First add it to your network and then you can set controls based on your controller. On my Vera Lite it is set up as a group so it can control the loads of other switches.. does this switch need to be wired by that I mean hard wired into the wall ? Yep. It's a bit confusing how they phrase it in the description, so I understand why you would ask this. The accessory switch requires power, i.e. 110v line, neutral, and ground. It communicates with the main switch, or your zwave controller, from there. It's hard wired in the sense that it needs 110v power, but does not directly get wired to the light or other output.. I have 6 - 3 way dimmer switches that I want to make Z-Wave. I have the Z-Wave controller. What is the cheapest and easiest way to do that? Which controller do you have? The cheapest way (not sure of your location) is to go your local LOWES hardware store and buy the GE IRIS 3- way setup with 2 switches in one box for 44.99. Your Probley going to have alot more questions tho. And you should be asking installation questions. Z-wave switches require a netural wire until non z-wave switches. I feel you should check out the forum of what ever controller your going to use and find out more info before buying. You can ask more questions here also if you'd like.. Do I need this switch if a circuit is already wired 3-way or in that case would I just use two Evolve LSM-15s? The 3way wiring becomes useless. I use the 5 associated with a 15 or LRM dimmer. You will need an Aeon Labs Minimote or similar to associate them unless you have a controller like Vera. The 5 is basically a scene controller. Actually just replaced a 4way with this configuration today.. CAN THIS SWITCH ACT AS A SIGNAL REPEATER? I am not using it as such, but yes I believe it does act as a repeater. Does this come with different color faceplates? Yes they do but they are sold separately.. \",\n",

       " 'what is the warranty on this product? 1yr if you can. Does it make nuggett ice that you can chew? They are round rather than square but yes they can be chewed. Different sizes can be adjusted for. It works fine if you clean it once in a while.. I bought the ice maker for my back patio. But, on page 1 of the inst. book, it says, do not use outside. Has anyone tried it? I leave in Florida. thx I do not use mine outside but know others who do in Az where it\\'s hot. What is the wattage and/or amperage of this ice maker? I am planning to put it in my RV and I wanted to know how long my marine battery will last. Hi RVer. Your question was not answered in the manual, but the tag on the machine reads; Ice Making Current 2.1 A and Ice Harvest Current 3.2 A. Hope this is helpful. Enjoy.. can you fill it with chilled refigerate water to make the ice quicker I dont see why not it only makes since. I bought this icemaker and the only issue if any is the ice gets dispenced into the bucket and tends to slope up against the side not filling the bucket all the way up. Craig.. What is the storage capacity for ice? It doesn\\'t store ice. It makes it and you either remove the cubes or the melt back into liquid to make ice again. We emptied each bin and froze in bags in freezer for use when needed or wanted. It does make ice quickly.. How much water does it\\'s reservoir hold? The reservoir holds exactly one gallon of water.. 50 lbs. of \"ice storage\" . . . does that mean that it will actually \"store\" ice for an extended period of time (several days, weeks)? It will not. Ice will last for hours not days in here as the unit itself is not a \"freezer\".. How do you use the timer? I have read the instructions several times but have yet to figure out out to adjust it... We don\\'t really use the timer, but if you want to turn it on or off you hit the timer button twice to turn it off when the ice maker is on, or to turn it on hit the timer button one when the maker is off. You can also unplug it and when you plug it back in the timer is working.. Should the LED display stay lit when it is powered on? It is hard to tell when it is actually on.... The only sure way to tell if it\\'s on is to listen to the noises it makes. The LED display is hard to read and unsatisfactory. Our unit sits on the floor and we have to bend all the way down or go on our knees to see the display. Nevertheless, I\\'d recommend this icemaker. They just need to improve that display, or place it on the lid, rather than on the front.. ',\n",

I\\'m trying the new LED bulbs to see if their lifetime is better. I bought the suction cup to unscrew the bulb a long time back - Almost any hardware store should have something similar - a cup holder with suction cup sounds about the right size. Caution - for a blown bulb, sometimes the suction cup simply pulls the glass from the front of the bulb - need a part of needle node pliers to get the bulb out if this happens.. Hi! Could some of you tell me if the base of this lightbulb is \"intermediate\"? The details say Base Type E27, which does not help. Thanks!!! These bulbs are medium, or standard sized base thread. Known as E27 in Europe (27mm diameter), and E26 in North American( 26mm diameter). They will not fit an intermediate socket. If you are looking for intermediate sized base, their designation is E17 in North America (17mm), and E14 in Europe (14mm diameter).. Is this the same thing as a \"PAR 16\" light, or similar \"standard\" size? Anyone know another way to buy the replacement (other than Dacor)? It is a European base JDR E27 I bought mine a few years ago from LSE Inc. (Actually I bought a pair incase they did not match the original brightness). They work great.. How do i change the bulbs? There should be a small suction cup that you apply to the bulb to unscrew it, I can\\'t recall if it came with the bulbs or not. Equivalent would be a small silicone suction cup used to attach hooks and such to windows ,as long as the cup is a bit smaller than the glass on the bulb it should work..

It\\'s mounted a little higher than me (5\\' 4\") & I can easily mount and dismount it.. how is this mounted--is there several screws that I have to put in my wall? the screws that come with this dryer does not hold it on the wall. They are too small and the dryer felt. I had to buy bigger ones to install it on the wall.. how do i know if it\\'s wattage is to high? I don\\'t want to blow a fuse. It uses 1350 watts, which is less than many hair dryers. Unless you have a unique situation, this should be a non-issue.. Stated dimensions in the description are 22x19x41 inches. I need to know which measurement is the width across and which is its depth when in use? The width across is slightly more than 19 inches. The depth is 22 inches. However, when the dryer is in use, the vinyl cover expands from the air blowing. You need to have an inch or 2 clear around the dryer for air circulation. The dryer has holes on the sides and bottom to work. It needs the air circulation. My dryer is mounted about an inch from my bedroom door when open and about 3 inches from my dresser. It expands as it blows air but doesn\\'t touch the door or dresser. I just leave it up and it looks like a hanging closet in my bedroom.. question about the moisture, does it release any while in use? how is it for RVs? Yes, the moisture is ultimately released through the holes in the plastic. Does this machine require a window to be opened for a vent? no...not at all. I have it mounted in my back hallway by a utility shelf with no windows around it....the hanging bag around the cloths has 5 small holes on each side of the top and a few on the very bottom that let out a small amount of air (hot/cold) but not enough to heat the area and absolutely no lint anywhere! I love this thing! I hang my towels on my balcony on pant hangers and let them dry a little before i hang them in the dryer to dry or they tend to be really stiff....but all the cloths dry soft.....and i really load this thing up and keep it drying most of the day....

Does anyone use this for drying coats after walking home in the rain? my daughter uses it to dry her jackets, her kids jackets and even in the summer to dry swim suites, so yes. can it be used to just warm clothing or towels?

Hi Julie, Like many said it doable but for a 5\" duct might be a little small. My was an 6\" duct and I end up going to Home Depot and get a reducer that cost about $12. I love how it look but installing it was a b*tch. It took a total of about 13 to 14 hours in a whole day for me to install mostly by myself. My wife did help me load it up into the packaging box that it came in. We use the box on top of the stove to support this range to help ease the load of loading it under our cabinet. This sucker weight like 40 to 50 pounds. Some of the nut and bolt that came with the package doesn\\'t feel secure for me. I don\\'t wanted the whole range drop down. I end up using toggle bolt that can handle 80+ lbs. each and use them on the top of the cabinet and use heavy duty dry wall anchor and screws that support 30+ lbs. for the side. This thing wasn\\'t going anyway. For the perfect next time I think I well drill hole that was 1/4\" bigger for running the power cord thru it. I end being slight not level on the range due to the cord bushing of the power cord on fitting the hole so it bumped 2cm higher and not set flat on it. Mounting the four top screw was a pain. Even with toggle bolt I have to end reverse mount it to make it easier to screw nut into the toggle bolt.. the range hood is defected. What to do??? go to the original order on amazon, they will connected with the factory to change your parts, you need to describe what happen in detail.. The manual doesn\\'t mention the bolts-n-nuts that came with the package. What\\'s the extra nuts and bolts for? I thought just need the screws to secure? It suggests to secure it using as many as screws possible. The hood comes with an extra black plate for hanging it over its back with those extra screws. Mine just hung over my cabinet without the black plate and those extra screws/nuts, and it works just good enough for us.. does this unit have a wall hanger to hold it in place while you secure the mounting screws/bolts? it looks heavy! or do i need some 2x4 and a jack?

I love it but I am going to work on a way to vent it out my window for the winter. I use the dryer about 4 times each week sense I got it and I have not seen any real increases in my electrical bill.

Per hour even would be great? I really have no idea...I haven\\'t noticed an increase in my electrical bill. A feature I like about this dryer is that the heat cycle moderates to a cool cycle. I find that my clothes are dry far sooner than I expected and I end up turning off the dryer long before the cycle is complete. I love my little dryer. Simple to use and does what it is supposed to without a problem.. How does one separate the first and second filters to remove the lint (not the felt circle but the first two)? At first it is kind of difficult. You have to pry open the filter. I used a knife. There are small tabs that hold the filter together. Once you pry them apart. it becomes much easier. Now I don\\'t have to do that. They come apart very easily now. Hope this helps.. how much stuff will fit in the dryer - can you dry towels? sheets? etc. Yes for towels, but it is small.

Frigidaire\\'s website shows the depth as 21 3/4, this description shows 21\". What is the exact depth? Cooktop has a slightly bowed front edge. The largest deminsion is front to back through the middle of the knobs. Mine measures 21 and 1/4 inches front to back. Of course the part of the stove that fits below countertop is smaller..

       " 'Do any of you vent your dryer? No, I don\\'t. I\\'ve had it for about 9 months and only put the plastic vent looking piece on top and use it like that. It sits in my living room corner. It blows warm air, so it can get a little warm in the room during warmer days. All you need to do is crack a window or door open.. Do you need to vent this to the outside? Thank you. I have mine sitting on the floor right by the window and all I do is crack my window open to let out the heat.. Dose it come with a Indoor Dryer Vent ? and Is it easy to clean the filter net? Yes. do I really need a venting hose? That would depend on whether you like warm moist air in the room where your dryer is located. I live in the southeast and we have enough humidity this time of year and beyond that I don\\'t want any more steamy air in my room. I open the window just enough for the venting hose to rest between the sill and the bottom of the open window. I put an old large beach towel next to the venting hose to keep hot air from getting inside. I would also expect that, over time, you might get some mildew if you don\\'t vent at all. I do not like the tub vent kit since it\\'s difficult for my arthritic hands to put the top and bottom together. There\\'s definite room for improvement here, Panda!. Does it plug into a regular outlet?? Yes, it does. Tanya D. You need an 3 prong outlet or adapter piece.. Someone else also posted in their review questions, don\\'t have too many appliances going that pull a lot of current while using it. It has blown a fuse when too many things are going. As it did with me.. But, outside of that, its very useful.. Can I use this dryer in a room with no windows? Will I have to buy a vent kit? Many thanks In my opinion - MAYBE. It comes with a four-piece hard plastic, sort of \"vent stack\" with top connection curved as if to direct the warm air that comes out of the dryer towards an outlet for the hot air. I can roll mine right up to a window so I didn\\'t need to buy flex-duct or anything to extend its venting. In the instructions it said something like - if you prefer not to vent the dryer through a window, you may just enjoy the \\'pleasant warming\\' it will provide to your room. Must be cold year round in China, huh? I didn\\'t mind a little \\'warming\\' in Jan-Feb. But it\\'s in the 90\\'s now in NYC. Don\\'t think I\\'d want to run it unvented in a windowless room today. But appears - from the instructions - to be possible; although maybe not always a practical idea. But that\\'s where we come back to the flex duct - you can buy that stuff by the mile I think, if you need to.. will this work for an Rv? My wife and I live in a 5th wheel trailer with laundry hookup\\'s I am thinking of buying this dryer will it work for my needs Yes this will work great as we also live in a 5th wheel.. What is the size of the vent? About 3 inches. what is the size in inches or centimeters,can I hang the dryer on the wall, my old one hangs I installed the two I bought on the wall about five feet of the ground. Since it was intalled at the corner of the room, it was easy to build a platform in wood to sit the dryers on top. My tenants like the fact it is mounted at about eye level and does not clutter the floor. Don\\'t know if I have answered your question. Where is it manufactured? I guess not Canada--I still cannot find the dryer filters--very fustrating. ',\n",

       " 'Has anyone bought this to work with a GWF compatible fridge? t does say it is compatible with GE Compatible Refrigerator Water Filter for MWF, GWF, MWFA, GWFA, GWF06 and it does fit. However, the water tasted and smelled worse with this filter than with the \"used GE filter\" that I was replacing. It was so bad, my brother-n-law that it was the old filter I was replacing, not the new one. So, I am using the GE Water filters from now on.. Everyone seems to be fully focused on the amount of saving! I am yet to see a comparison of the quality of water from the original MWF GE vs. this one My tap water is so bad. I can smell and taste the chlorine and have always bought bottled water, until this new refrigerator. I tried the water from the dispenser and it is fine. After buying the compatible filter after the first six months, I see no difference in the quality. It is just as good as the original GE filter and will continue to purchase them from the seller I used. Saving on both filters and bottled water.. Does your filter -filter out the same things the GE filter does? if not, what are the differences? IT SURE SEEMS LIKE IT DOES....WATER TASTES GREAT!. Where is this filter made? Just checked mine, all it says is manufactured by spaceflex international LLC. It does not have a made in china stamp anywhere on the filter. I was pretty sure thats a legal requirement if its made overseas, I dont have the box anymore so I cant check that, hope this helps.. What are the NSF Certification numbers for this filter, and where is it made? Im not sure if this is what you are asking for, the box says the filter has been tested by the manufacturer against ANSI/NSF Standard 42 for the reduction of chlorine,tastes,and odors. It doesn\\'t actually have the NSF stamp on it though like the ge water filter box that i have. It is made in the USA and the ge box that I have says assembled in Eagan,MN. I never really paid much attention until i was asked this question. I hope this helps W floyd. hi, how can i tell if this will fit my fridge? I have a GE profile fridge Hello, just check in your fridge manual if your fridge can operate with MWF, GWF,MWFA OR GWFA refrigerator filter. If you don\\'t have your fridge manual, check your current filter inside the fridge, is an information label on front the filter that say the filter type.. what country was this manufactured in? i looked on mine and found no markings, i can say this for less than half what one costs at lowes, and the great job it it doing for me, don,t care if it was made on the moon. Has anyone determined if the \"Water Filter\" lamp on their GE Frig operates properly with these third party filters? Has GE patent expired? I just replaced my filter with a 3rd party brand and was able to reset my filter light - it went off after I held it for the required amount of time. I\\'ve used 3rd party filters more than the GE ones and have had no trouble.. Are these NSF 42 and 53 like the original GE MWF? Thanks. Yes. I didn\\'t notice any difference.. It says the filter will not be compatible for GE Refrigerators manufactured after Jan 2014? Is this correct? It worked great on my GE Refrigerator. I had no problems installing. I will buy it again..

You can purchase this unit along with a portability kit which includes the casters by searching for CWD1510WPORTK.. How does it hook up AND Drain? needs a regular washer hot/cold water and drain box hookup. doesn\\'t need a vent for the dryer though. ventless.. does it remove lint and hair from clothing? It did a good job, yes. Lint comes from the laundry detergent you use-it breaks down fibers and wears out the fabric of your clothing. I use Melaleuca laundry detergent and brightener and have very little lint to deal with, plus it does a great job on cleaning. This little machine cleaned my clothes better than any other I\\'ve used. It doesn\\'t take a large load of clothes, so you will do a few more loads than you\\'re use to, and it takes a few more cycles in the dryer to dry them, but it\\'s super cheap to operate and your clothes are CLEAN! The lint trap is at the bottom of the machine, a little plug you pull out and clean off.. does it have delay start? Yes. The minimum delay is 1 hour and it goes in 1h intervals from there. Can we schedule the dry and wash cycle together? so we can start the wash and dryer together. Now I need to restart the dryer manually after wash Yes. After you put it on the cycle you want, press the \"add dry time\" button.. This says it has built in water heater. Does that mean I don\\'t need to use hot water? Do I have to hook hot water to it? It still needs hot water hooked up to it in order to work properly.. I have tight space requirement. How many inches of clearance is required behind for hook-ups? Free inches just for hoses ... great for tight spaxes. ',\n",

You would have to install the duct and outdoor hardware to complete the job, (not included with the hood). I used it to replace an existing hood that vented out the back into a duct already in the wall and it mated up nicely with the old opening.. Is the hood compatible with a wall duct above the stove?

There are 10 panels which you interlock by \"stacking\" one on top of the other. If you head over to proslat.com, you can see videos of what the individual panels look like. The panels are 8ft. wide, and when all 10 panels are interlocked, they reach 4ft high (so each panel exposes about 4.8\" of height). They are not 10 panels of 8x4\\'s; this is the total area they cover.

There is a cover so it never falls out like in some fans.. Where can I purchase an extension for this range hood? Please answer at your earliest convenience. There is an extension that comes with this hood. I don\\'t know if an additional extension could be installed with the one provided.. Can this be installed on outside wall? I am planning to install on wall that is 4 feet away from outside wall. It can be installed on any wall that has and exhaust pipe to outside. It also needs hardwired in or a plug to plug in, it has the capability of both.. is this ventless? As I read in the instructions it\\'s possible to do. I installed mine with a vent. It\\'s a good idea to vent it as the blower motor is fairly powerful.. Does anyone know if this hood can be turned into ductless? Yes. You can use it for ductless. But, it\\'s fitting may not be part of the package. Since I am using with duct, I couldn\\'t recall the original package item.. is this unit able to be wired or does it have a plug for 110? It is not hard wired. It is plugged in to an outlet behind the metal chimney above the hood.. ',\n",

Do you sell an extension kit available for 10\\' ceilings? Thats for the Vendor to answer.. what is the width of the chimney? 12\"(w) x 10.75\"(d) The only complaint that I have is the mounting bracket. It\\'s solid design makes it difficult to mount the hood, especially if you have low ceilings. Otherwise, it is a nice hood.. Is this hardwired or plugin? Hard wired.. does it need pipes to get the smoke out of the house? Yes, you need a duct leading to the outside.. I have 1\" less than eight foot ceilings (95\"), can this unit work? A hole has to be cut into the ceiling so that the unit can be securely attached to the attic rafters. This added height will provide for any flexibility that is required.

I would like to know if this unit operators when it first starts up and open the hot and cold water valves. Does it open and close the valves very fast causing water hammer. Or does just open letting the drum fill up, because I have an LG washer that... Hi Gregory, Thanks for the question. Samsung HE Washers cycle the valves while water is entering in order to regulate the temperature which is measured by an internal thermostat. The recommended water pressure specification for this and other Samsung Washers is 20-116 psi. I can't tell you whether you would experience pipe hammer with a machine other than the one you currently own, but if so, I would suggest contacting a plumber for assistance. - Ms. Samsung. Can you stack the washer and dryer? With the purchase of a stacking kit, yes.. How long is the normal wash cycle? Dear Jared, Unfortunately, the manufacturers do not list the average time for a wash cycle with their specifications since it can vary greatly depending on the settings you have chosen. If you are concerned that it is running too long, please contact Samsung directly and they can help you troubleshoot if it is running too long for that setting.. can i use ordinary detergent for model; WF365BTBGWR? Yes, both liquid and dry. Just remove the insert, to add dry detergent.. What clear coat should be used, brand wise? Clear coat is usually for metal and we are talking about multiple types of material on the panel??? I have not had any issues with the new panels, but my thought was to use the 3m protective film like you can get for cars if it started smearing again.. \",\n",

       " 'how do I make the LG machine washer front load take more water? I am not quite sure I understand the question. Generally speaking my answer to ANY question pertaining to this model is A) RETURN IT NOW!!!! If it is less than 30 days old, or whatever window from the place of purchase. I wish dearly someone had given me that advice when I made the HORRID mistake of purchasing this worthless machine. B) Buy another washing machine that is NOT LG. I had to buy a GE about 6 months after I purchased this model BRAND NEW. but FINALLY i have clean clothes!!!! When I was using this NIGHTMARE machine, I would have to set it on \"Bulky bedding\" setting in order to get enough water in the drum to actually get the clothes wet enough to get clean. So yes, you have to set it to \"bulky / bedding\", stand over the machine for however long it takes to fill, then pause it, power off, then power back on and then chose the appropriate wash setting. WAY TO GO LG!!!!!!!! Congratulations on making the WORST most useless washing machine EVER!!!!. Can you open the door and add another piece of laundry after the machine has started? I think they call it a \"pause\" function. Yes, there is a \"pause\" function. Still extremely happy with my purchase of this machine. If you buy this though just remember to change the water temperature! It defaults to the \"hot\" setting when you select a wash type.... I have this washer and even brand new it had an odd smell to it inside, kinda stinky when I stick my head in and smell. Is this normal? Mine is a year old and it has never had any weird or stinky smell to it. Make sure you are using he detergent and leaving the top open when it is not in use.. Mine does not spin fast, clothes are so heavy with water.Had 2 electricians out.This is my 2nd one,returned 1st-DKW to do. What\\'s wrong? I haven\\'t had that problem. I don\\'t see that you have a choice, but to return this one too.i. I know it\\'s such a hassle, but I returned two. I bought the LG, never had any machine clean that well and clothes came out almost dry. I loved the machine but it kept getting off balance. A few times it stopped and wouldn\\'t right itself so back it went to Lowes. I ordered a whirlpool. Didn\\'t like that at all. So, then I returned the Whirlpool to Lowes and reordered another Wt110. Took nerve to do that (: I haven\\'t had any problems with it, but it seems to be an entirely different machine. No balance problems but it doesn\\'t clean or treat my clothes as gentley as the first. It\\'s still better than the Whirlpool . Lowes was wonderful to work with.. inside drum is wobbling GE GTWN 4250 is the one I got, it was on sale at Sears over the Holiday weekend. Just make sure it will work with your drain set up. We have old house with a higher stand pipe and I don\\'t think it quite drains all the way. Other than that it is a FANTASTIC washing machine! My clothes are actually CLEAN and it doesn\\'t take two hours to wash a single sheet!!!. Has anyone used the self-cleaning function? If so, how often - or, when/why would I use this? The washer uses very little water as a result the dirt and dog hair don\\'t fully rinse out. That cycle is suppose to help flush it out however it didn\\'t work so after owning it for 2 weeks during witch we had the service technician come out and he flat out said to return it because it was a Bad model so we did a ended up buying a set of speed queens witch work 100 times better. .good luck........... what are lg wt1101cw dimensions? WxHxD 27 x 40 5/32 28 3/8 (54 1/3 with the lid open). how do you place bleach in washing machine any help I cant figure it out thanks Front left corner is a reservoir for bleach. Pour in to the full mark. The machine releases at the appropriate time.. Can high efficient washing machine be kept in an outside storage shed? Yes. You could be risking moisture on electrical components. Temperature controlled environment would be a better way to go.. Why does this machine bother to include 5 temperature settings when anything other than \"hot\" gives cold water. Where is the real \"warm\" water option? It all depends on how \"hot\" your water heater is and how cold your line is coming in from the street. If your water heater is less than 125 degrees Fahrenheit, you\\'ll get a cooler water than warm.. ',\n",
       " 'does it have a built in water heater? It has hot and cold water hoses, same as a standard washer. It does not heat water itself. I have been using mine for a month now and am pleased with the overall quality. It takes a little longer to dry than a vented dryer but it does work. It does offer an advantage of not switching clothes from washer to dryer(you can load the machine and leave home, have the load complete when returning home hours later). How high does the drain connection need to be and can it be on the side wall? I used the drain that was used for my old washer. It is on the wall about 3 feet high. I have no problems with this configuration.. Does the delivery include the hose connection as well? If not, was it easy to connect all? It comes with everything you need to stall. I would pay for it to be brought inside and installed if it is an option It is not light weight. Also, make sure you are okay with letting clothes airdry a little. I love it but towels and bulkier items just do not completely dry.. Does it fit a space with a 27.25 inch depth? I\\'m not sure how much space needed foir hoses. Yes it\\'s ventless. You need maybe 2-3 inches for hoses.. Do the water hoses come with it? Yes they do Very nice unit. how does this unit connect to a kitchen sink? I have it connected to a water line. I don\\'t know if you can connect it to the sink.. Dimensions show 25 1/4 Depth - with normal units 5\" more is required for vent, water hoses, etc. Does this system really fit in 25\"?

       " 'How are the Oxygen Adsorbers used What makes food go stale and spoil quickly is oxygen, by using these oxygen absorbers they reduce that. I dehydrate fruit and vegetables in a food dehydrator then place them in clean mason jars and add one oxygen absorber and close up the jar. In a about 4-6 hours you will hear the top pop inward and the oxygen has been taken out. These jars I use in daily cooking. For long-term food storage I put the dehydrated food into a vacuum seal bag and put in one oxygen absorber then vacuum seal removing all the air, this bag is put into a mylar bag and sealed, then put into a 5-gallon bucket with two oxygen absorbers (food can last for 20 years). All the food we have done this with has been perfect. I hope this helps.. do i need more than 1-100cc for 1qt vac packed quart jar. No. the 300cc size says it is good for a gallon. so one should be fine for a quart jar.. I noticed this morning there was moisture on the inside of the jar I keep them in and they feel hot when touched. Is this normal? Are they still good? Probably not. They react to the O2 in whatever environment they are in. If you are keeping them in a mason jar there is a lot of O2 in there, especially if you are constantly opening the jar. Best way to use them is to plan ahead and use them only as needed. I use them when dehydrating vegetables or making jerky. I portion out the vegetables or jerky into vacuum bags, open the vacuum bag containing the Oxy-Sorbs, take out the number required and immediately reseal the bag containing them. I then put a Oxy-Sorb AND a desiccant packet into the vacuum bag with the product and seal it. I keep all the dehydrated products in PLASTIC .50 caliber ammo cans in a freezer, (labeled, dated, etc.) and have found NO deterioration in the products for over 3 years. The Oxy-Sorb is great for long-term storage of products, if used properly.. What would the shelf life be of jerky sealed with these in mylar bags at ROOM TEMPERATURE? You would need to vacuum seal the jerky with these oxygen absorbers to make the self life last a while, and then you can put the vacumm sealed jerky into a Mylar bag with a couple oxygen absorbers and seal. That would increase the life of the jerky. Since jerky has fat it can go rancid the the self life will not be very long. maybe 6 months to a year if vacuum sealed and then put in Mylar bag.. How do you properly close and seal the bag once you have opened it? with a bag sealer....same way you close the food storage bag after placing the correct amount of absorbers in.. I PURCHASED OXY SORB 100CC had no knowledge of use of. Opened pack took some out.. Unused ones got hot &amp; indicator purple. R they now bad If you didn\\'t reseal the package in something air-tight ( like a jar) then they are probably bad. You can test if you fill a jar with something simple ( rice, beans, etc) and put one or more in, seal the jar, and see if the lid \"pops\" down via vacuum pressure- That would indicate the rest are still probably good. However, I also found with mine that a lot of them were not good from the get-go, even after keeping them in an airtight jar.. So we put an entire packet into what you are about to seal? Making baked goods to ship. Will these help our goods stay fresh longer while shipping? Absolutely, they will stay fresh as long as the container isn\\'t opened or damaged. Suggest maybe a tin can to shop in. They are great for long term storage also.. What\\'s the shelf life? Keep the UNUSED product in a vacuum-sealed bag and they last forever.. Should these little 100cc absorbers warm up when exposed to air? I have not noticed them warming up. I usually put them in a vacuum zip lock type of storage bag right away. If you leave them out too long they will be unable to absorb oxygen in a closed environment.. I want to give sealed (quart) gift bags of buttered, seasoned popcorn to friends. How long will the 100cc packets keep the bags fresh? HELP! The packets should keep the the popcorn fresh as long as the bag is closed.. ',\n",
       " 'Does this make \"soft\" ice (easy to chew instead of solid blocks)? It makes round blocks. Not easy to chew.. I just received this product this week. I waited two days before turning it now. Added water, but it has been two hours and no cubes. Any ideas? Turn the machine off and unplug it from the power outlet. Allow it to sit and hour or two unplugged, and then empty out all water you may have put in the machine. Put new water into the reservoir making certain you do not fill it above the maximum fill line. Distilled water is best, and will save you time down the road from having to clean off excessive mineral deposits from the freezing elements, but at minimum use good filtered water and not the junk that comes straight from the faucet. Next, plug the machine back in and press the power button. Do not attempt to set the clock or the timer. Ignore those buttons completely. Select your ice size (it really doesn\\'t matter which one you choose just to test the machine - any size will do.) You should almost immediately hear the machine pumping water from the reservoir into the freezing chamber. It will sound like water quietly trickling and lasts a couple of seconds. If you hear that, you know the pump is working. You should also hear the compressor kick on after the water has been pumped into the freezing chamber, and if you place your hand next to the the exhaust port you ought to begin feeling slightly warmed air blowing out. Within 10 to 12 minutes your first batch of ice will be done. You hear very audibly when the machine slides the ice off the freezing elements and they tumble onto a temporary holding platform. Then you will hear the ice being raised up on the platform and pushed off of it down into the catch basket. The clattering of the ice is unmistakable. If these things do not happen within 12 to 15 minutes of when you turned the power on, something is not right with the machine. You\\'ll most likely need to notify Amazon and have it replaced.. It sounds as though it makes ice very quickly, but after they fall into the storage bin, they no longer stay frozen. Is this true? How much usable ice The ice cubes fall into the storage bin and they melt very little because all the ice cubes create a \"cold\" temperature in the bin. Once the bin becomes full the ice maker stops making ice until the bin is emptied. I have been gone longer than six hours and the cubes still very large with minimal melting. The ice maker has great insulation to keep the temperature as cold as possible.. What are some of the defects that require the unit to be returned? If this is the same product that I own (it looks like it) I have found NO defects in it. It makes ice quickly. It obviously isn\\'t a freezer, so one shouldn\\'t expect it to stay frozen for an extended period.. What method/s work best to drain the unit? It was mentioned that a filter slowed the process, is it removable? Yes, the product has a drain however, drain hole is small and drainage is slow. I have the unit next to a sink, therefore - I manually empty the water out by just tipping it over to empty the water. The unit is heavy - so the process is rather clumsy. I would not be deterred from purchasing the product due to that issue.. I like the crystal ice cubes, I\\'m tired of the white bitter-flavor ice of my fridge. Is it possible with this ice maker? To answer your question, I must address your concerns about \"white\" and \"bitter-flavor\" separately. Yes, these ice cubes are white, not crystal clear. The white color is from air entrapped as the cubes form on the refrigerated rods. The entrapped air makes the ice cubes \"soft\" and easily chewed if you are inclined to chew ice. We love this consistency. These ice cubes do not, however, have a bitter flavor. As I stated in my review, you must clean the ice maker when you first use it to get rid of the slight \"new plastic\" taste, but after that the ice does not have any bad flavor. We love this ice machine! Hope this helps.. Help- it leaks!! We just got ours set up today. It works quickly and makes good ice but we can\\'t ignore the leak. Any suggestions for a quick fix??? it has a tiny little plug on the side, (drain side) check to see if it in securely... a very small piece.... What is the measurements? The measurements are 11 1/2 wide 14 1/2 deep and 13 1/2 tall. About the same size as a larger bread maker.. Unit makes loud screeching or scraping sound at start of every new cycle for about 60 seconds. Not fan. Anyone else experience this? Nope, what we hear is the water filling and the flap rising but it isnt loud, screeching, or scraping. You may need to exchange your unit. There may be a defect with that particular one. Good Luck!.

Does anyone know where I can get install instructions for this on a kitchenaid KUDS30IXWH1 http://www.appliancepartspros.com/upper-rack-track-parts-for-kitchenaid-kuds30ixwh1.html Open the link showing a diagram of your top rack. Part number 2 is the part you are looking at on Amazon. Remove rack from dishwasher (there is a retainer at the end of each drawer track that needs to be either removed or opened and the tray will slide out). Carefully unclip Part #11 from the rack and slide down ward until it will unclip from the rack adjuster. Mine were very brittle from age and I snapped one off. Remove second retaining clip part #12. Hard to explain how to do this, but it is not difficult. Release the middle of it, slide it upward and and it will come off. Remove the last retainer, part #9. I used a small screw driver to assist in releasing it. Next use a small screw driver to pry apart parts 8 & 10. The top part is tabbed and the bottom part snaps together so I gently pried it apart from the bottom sides (there was a small notch i could easily get into). The rack adjuster will now slide off. Do one at a time and use the other as a reference. Assembly is the reverse. Take you time - shouldn't take over 45-60 minutes. First side takes the longest, after you do one the other is easy. Hope this helps.. Does this part come with two wheels? Or do I have to order them separately ? I wondered about that too because it didn't show the wheels in the photo, but mine came with the wheels!. I am actually searching for a Kitchenaid part # W10353546, W10250158, or W10250159 is this the same part? this is the correct part I just called kitchenaid because I have the same issue! They told me that it would work. Very dissapointing to me to spend as much money as I did on a kitchenaid and have it break after 6 months!. Will this part fail like the original? Our upper rack is falling off, breaking items on the lower rack. My guess is yes. I run my dishwasher every day and I have replaced these parts once a year. I bought it in October of 2012 and replaced them in October of 2013 and 2014. It's just cheap plastic clips holding the wheels on and the manufacturer seems to have no interest in actually improving the part.. left side broken on this part, handyman came and replaced this with W10350376, now right side broke, is it the same part as left side ones ? Yes it is the same part and when I ordered it it came with two and they are way better than the original ones. Does this work for both sides?? Yes. I bought 2, one for each side. Worked great.. I have a Kenmore dishwasher with the same part number and it looks exactly the same as this whirlpool part. Will it work for our Kenmore dishwasher? I am somewhat confident that Whirlpool corporation makes their own brand, Kitchen Aid and Maytag, so why not make Kenmore dishwashers too? I would suspect that if the parts were not interchangeable, there would be a different part number. They are cheap, and you will know the instant you remove the old broken part if the new one is identical. I wish you luck changing them out. But once you learn the trick, it's easy as pie.. I have a Kenmore dishwasher with the same part number and it looks exactly the sam as this whirlpool part. Will it work for our Kenmore dishwasher? It worked for ours. Not too difficult.

They sent me a new pair, no charge.. Is this product ventless/ductless? I can\\'t install a vent hood that requires a duct leading outside. Thank you for your help! It can be set up either way. we did the ventless, works great..you do have to order filter covers for the fan if ventless..those are about another 40 dollars. have fun. Is this a convertible hood that I can vent outside with? yes you can but you would have to add some duct work, but that is what we did.. what is manufacturer\\'s warranty? 2 years...hope this helps!. Hello, I have AKDY 30\" hood and I have a problem with digital clock. The clock has behind for a couple hours every day. Please can you help me. Yep, mine loses time, too. So, I contacted the company and they sent me a new circuit board and control panel. However, the installation seemed so involved that I haven\\'t done it yet. I\\'m thinking about putting a nice magnet over it. Because, you know, aside from the clock issue, it seems to be a great range hood!. Can i go straight up and then vent it out above the 8 ft ceiling line (meaning straight shot upwards) And do i have an option to go 90 degrees? Yes...we went up an 90 degrees.. I will be removing my microwave to put this range hood on and I have two cabinets above the microwave. Do I have to remove the cabinets? Yes. Will this work for an island? No because the back is exposed.. Will it vent out the back? If you already have a vent to the outside or you will have to do it yourself.Comes with... but may have to buy the clamps to fit. What kind of light bulb base size is used? Is it something standard I can buy off the rack locally? Good news and Bad news. Since the fixtures are LED, the bulbs should last a long time. Unfortunately, the instructions which came with it indicate the fixture, not the bulb must be replaced. Additional side note, the lights are virtually useless located in the back of the hood, since they aren\\'t very bright. The clock also loses an hour per day (but who needs another clock in the kitchen). Stylish, but we would buy something a little better quality, next time.. ',\n",

So it just pulls air up through filter? Are the light bulbs easily changable? Double check with manufacturer, but I believe you have to buy a separate kit to have it recirculate. Not sure about bulbs, as I have not needed to change them. However I don\\'t expect to since they are LED.. What is the minimum height at which this product can be installed? I believe it was 28\" - 33\" that the specs recommended. I\\'m tall, so I went higher than specified, but It works great even on the low fan setting; which is much quieter.. Does this AKDY 30\" Island Mount Stainless Steel Range Hood come with a mounting kit or do you need to purchase it separately It came with everything I needed.

I know most of the hoods are adjustable for 8 - 9\\' ceilings. Not sure.. I have mine mounted on my kitchen cabinets, what I call a faux float.. I have it vented through the side of my house with a 90degress angle b/c I did not want to cut into the roof. Does this have to be hard wired?or can it be plugged into an outlet? It comes with a standard 3 prong plug to plug it in to an outlet.. Can it be raised after installation - wanting the height to be higher it was installed at 36\" want to raise to 30\" The person who installed it for me said if I wanted it higher after installation I would have have to uninstall it and change the components before reinstall it.

Hood keeps going off by its self, anyone else have this problem? Yes mine turns off and on. It will also go on by itself and if you tap the side it turns off.. Are the lights able to dim? No, they don\\'t and its a pretty bright light.. What is the length from top to bottom of just the hood (not including the stem)? About 10 3/16 inches. is this setup to be ventless? It is capable of being ventless. You\\'ll have to either buy the kit that has the duct work to push the air through the fins or build your own and buy the separate carbon filters that clean the air.. I have a gas stove and want to do install hood as ventless using the charcoal filters. Never had a gas stove so is that safe way to use the hood? I wouldn\\'t recommend using without running the vent.it\\'s really simple if u are handy. Can I get an extension for a 10 foot ceiling? It came with two stainless chimneys...we only used one for an 7\\' 8\" ceiling. You might end up a little short for a 10\\', but you could probably fix that with a moulding around the ceiling.. Is this a hard wire installation or plug-in? Plug in. what is the shortest lenth from top to bottom, i have 7ft ceiling Approximately 27\". Does this vent externally?

To be sure you can inspect the filter while it is still in the refrigerator and make sure the filter model is the same.. same as Kenmore? Not the same, for LG product. When we first replaced the filter the water ran black for a while - which i guess is normal - but the replace filter light has come back on. Why? I don\\'t really have an answer but I have replaced my filter twice and it did not run black either time. The instructions said to run it several times prior to drinking the water. My guess is that whatever made it run black also quickly clogged the filter causing the replace filter light to come on.. why is this item so expensive. I have seen other site that you can get 3 for the same price. I have always trusted Amazon to have the best price, no m You see it cheaper but not originals.

You would have to put one shirt on top of another which, to my mind, defeats the purpose. I mostly use it as a way of ironing my clothes so the look neat & fresh. I use it to dry shirts that would start to look old & shabby if they were dries in the dryer. If you just want to dry several items it would probably be faster to do one after another--the Vapper gets most of my stuff dry in 5-10 minutes..

I have a year old Black Ice French door Wirlpool refrig. How can I find out if the filter fits this model? If it currently has a filter, remove it and order the same thing.

Good luck.. Can I get a block off cap instead of using a filter, do they make one to replace this filter? No. I am thinking about getting a pack of three as it is cheaper than the single pack.

Jenate It\\'s not the product Your refrigerator has a timer that stats when you replace your filter If your water still taste good all you have to do is take the filter out again and re install it This will reset your timer But Amazon has the best price on replacements.

The only cookware that can be used on an Induction cook top is ones that can be magnetized. Get a small magnet and test the bottom of the ones you already have.

       " 'Does this mount to the wall without a cabinet? And does it come with the mounting kit? Yes it is a wall mount hood that does not require a cabinet. It also comes with what you need to mount it on the wall.. Ok - a little dumb here - can the vent duct run up the standard height then turn and go out the back of the wall it is on? Does an \"L\" duct come with It comes with a flex duct, there is no need for a L duct, just bend the flex duct to the desired angel. Yes you can turn the pipe out the back of wall.. Clock keeps army time can it be converted to standard 12 hour I wish I knew, mine has never worked right !. is this a back exhaust I think it can be back or top. We ran ours up the top through the chimney provided.. Do I need an extension for a 10\\' ceiling? If so, do you sell one? My 8\\'1\" ceiling allowed me to extend mine only about 2\". This left about 15\" of chimney extension unused. If my calculations are correct, I believe you will need an additional 8\" of chimney after fully extended. My measurements are with the vent hood mounted 25\" above my stove surface. The chimney is 17\" with a 17\" extension supplied. I do not know if they sell extensions separate but my guess is they probably do and I would call the company if I were you, just to be sure! GoodLuck .... I LOVE MINE :). I need to know what width and depth of the chimney are and whether it can cover an 8\" duct at the top It comes with flexible 6 in duct. You would need 8 in to 6 in duct reducer.. are there extensions available? Sorry, I\\'m not quite sure what extensions you would be referring to. I was able to google Golden Vantage and get a phone number because I first ordered the wrong size, they were very easy to talk to (cost me $80 to ship it back!). The unit I bought looks and runs great and was a good value for the money.. Does this work as a ductless range hood? Or does it have to be vented outside Ours is vented outside, but it can be used as a ductless range hood if you prefer.. Hi, what is the depth of this hood, measured from the fan base to the chimney extension fully extended? I\\'d like this to be at least 41.7\". Thanks! Sorry but this is about 36\" tall and you would need a different top extendion but you can find them online. Where do I find installation instructions, I have misplaced mine... Installation instructions really aren\\'t very helpful. They are terribly translated engrish and basically say: screw into wall, use 6\" duct to exhaust to exterior of building. Probably would be better to find a generic hood vent install guide on a blog or YouTube.. ',\n",
       " 'What is the maximum distance the bottom of the hood hangs from the ceiling once attached? Mine hangs down 30\" for an 8 ft. ceiling, It was actually made for a 9 ft. ceiling which would allow it to hang down at least 42\". They said it would work for an 8 ft. ceiling , but I had to cut some off the brackets and the stainless steel columns to make it work.. Is there a minimum height? I have about 22\" height to work with. Can only one of the 19\" chimney\\'s be used or will the two \"telescope\" so it\\'s 19\"? Yes they are adjustable. They will telescope. Is their an attachment we can buy? We have 10ft ceilings. I don\\'t think you need one. We have 9 ft ceilings and set it at the highest adjustment to allow for a more comfortable work area and better looking island. The exhaust is perfectly adequate for the bigger gap between stove and hood. . Should be fine to set at the lower point for 10 ft ceilings.. Is this model to be used for an island only? It is finished on all four sides as if intended to be used in an island or peninsula. However I do not see any reason why you would not be able to use it close to a wall. Just bear in mind that the hood part sticks out further than the chase on all four sides and plan accordingly. How can I get instruction book to install the hood, therewas no book in a package? here is a pdf link: http://akdytrading.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Golden-Vantage-10A3-Wall-Mount-range-hood.pdf i love my hood, installation was not easy (im a pro plumber and damn good at everything else). goodluck!! This is the distributors phone number (626) 350-8360. They arent very attentive to the phone, but they will get back to you and accommodate a guide. put a surge protector where you plug in!!!!!! motherboard can fry in lightning storm. what do i need to use as in a ductless application? sounds like you need to buy a model that uses ductless venting. This model doesnt have that feature. Golden vantage has several models that come with a ductless vent although they dont work well but something is better than nothing!. Do you have extensions for a 10 ft ceiling Sorry no.... Does this product come with the install kit? I believe this came with everything needed to install up to the ceiling. We used it for an island range. Once installed, it looks awesome--more expensive than it actually was. I am happy with the level of air extraction despite not having a wall behind the range to channel steam up. The 4 LED lights are good enough to light the cooking area, although they do have a blue cast kind of like old school fluorescent lights which looks a little eerie. I am not sure if these can be replaced with LEDs with a warmer cast. When running, it is a little noisy. The removable metal vents tend to rattle against the metal vent openings in the main housing. This can probably be solved with foam tape. I am surprised that it did not come with foam gaskets around the vent openings.. is this hood is ductless ? Sorry I do not know. This hood is still sealed in the box as I ordered the island hood by mistake for a remodel and when we discovered it was the wrong one it was to late to return.. ',\n",

There are white knobs protruding from the outside of the metal \"basket\" into which the bag goes and there are holes in the plastic bags which will fit perfectly around those knobs holding the bag in place. I used to get the paper bags from Sears. They would occasionally leak and fall apart when I pulled the bag out if the kids accidentally put something really moist in the compactor. The plastic bags are lighter, easier to handle and have never leaked. I was actually skeptical that they would do the job but they are far superior. Good luck!. Are twist ties included? Yes they are.

       " \"I got this item and I'm having a lot of problems with lint. The lint filter is a useless, don't hold nothing! Please I need help with the lint. I've had this machine for over a year, it works great but if you have clothes that tend to shed a lot you will have lint issues. in this machine it only takes a few minutes to was clothes. It is not like the regular washers. As a rule of thumb if it is an item being washed just because I wore it once I use the three minute cycle, if I wore it outside and it got dirty I adjust the time accordingly. Lightly dirty about 6 minutes, moderate dirty 9 minutes and heavy grime 12 minutes. You will have to play with the times and degree of dirtyness. Overall these are great machines for an apartment dweller. Unfortunately they do have some limits. If you are getting a lot of lint, try decreaseing the time especially if the clothing is not grimey. Usually an item worn on one or two days just needs a light washing in this machine. I usually run the extractor for 2 minutes. Most loads take a total of 5 minutes start to finish.. Can someone give me a concrete estimate of how many pieces of clothing this can fit? How many shirts, how many pant, how many towels etc. All depend on the sizes. I wear x-large shirts and I can fit 5-6 if they are lightweight. Bluejeans, 1-2. If there is too much, nothing moves. Bathtowels-large only 2. Smaller towels 4-5 plus washrags. most loads are best if they are combinations of face towels, washrags, shorts and shirts. 2 shirts, 2 shorts, 3 face towels, and multiple washrags fits fine. If you do sheets, one at a time with something else is best. If you wash both at a time, which you can they fit, they get wrapped up in each other and neither gets washed. Hope that helps.. The box that it arrives by fedex, does it say washing machine because landlord and nosey neighbors may have a problem. Del. 5/1 but I'm at work. No. My box just said Panda XPB36. There were no diagrams on the box either.. So, this has to be plugged in AND near a sink, or such? That worries me that my counter won't be big enough, etc.? This is a floor model, easy to move. I drain it in the shower.. What's the difference between model XPB36 and PAN30? The XPB36 probably needs to sit on the floor as the drain hose has to be lifted 7 inches higher than its connection point to the machine. The PAN30 can sit on the counter or anywhere and the drain hose needs to be laid flat or dropped into a container/sink large enough to catch all the water that drains out. The PAN30 drains by gravity. Hope that helps!. Is this designed and sized to be aconmidating for use in an RV or Travel Trailer? Yes. I use mine in our motorhome. I put it in the shower and use my hand-shower head to fill it and just let it drain out the drain hole of the shower. Works great for me.. How does the spin dryer drain? Does it utilize the hose? When you use the spinner, it drains to the same pump the washer bin drains to. In other words, if you hook the drain tube to your sink and switch it to drain, the spinner water will drain out of that as well. Hope this helps!. Does this machine vibrate much? I live on the third floor, and can't have it banging, or movind If you overload the spin dryer it will vibrate at first but as soon as it picks up spead it does not. just don't overload it also I have the bigger one so this is my opinion having the larger one the one that's does twelve pounds of laundry.. How does this unit compare to the older Panda washer without the integral spinner? Is the washer part larger, easier to use? Already use the Panda with separate spinner; would there be any benefit in getting this unit to replace existing arrangement? This is not actually a newer model, but rather a different one. The washer is a bit larger I would say, but in practicality it has the same power. The built in spinner allows for easy transfer of sopping wet clothing without drips on the floor. You can even pull them out of the wash basin while it is still full and throw them right in the spinner to do a rinse and dry. In the end though, if you are thinking about putting down another $150ish bucks when you already have the standalone panda, I would HIGHLY recommend getting the 3,200 RPM spinner with the stainless drum here on Amazon. It is somewhere around that price, but it can hold an entire load from the Panda, and will dry the clothes to almost 100% dry in just a few minutes. This dual unit has a 120 watt 1,300 RPM (The smaller stand alone spinner is actually faster at 1,600 RPM!) spinner that holds less than half of one load from the washing side. The 3,200 RPM one has 400 watts of power and can hold over 11lbs of clothes! Unless the drain pump is super important to you I would skip this one. If I were you I would keep the stand alone Panda and upgrade your dryer! :) Hope this helps!. I received my Panda washer and have all ready lost my instructions! Do I fill the water to below the lint trap or just above it? Thanks! Fill up to below side opening on right. Cloths must wash loosely. Beware of knotting. Dont use a lot of detergent. Use liquid soap. Make sure drain hose is secured. Do not overload spinner. It is a hands on machine works great for small easy washes.. \",\n",

I eventually had to return this part after I received and installed the correct one. My account was credited for the cost of the part.. I had to pay the shipping, each way ($15.00 x2), and that is not right. The big problem with Amazon is you cannot contact them.. Ther is no phone no. If you email them its generic I.e. they don't read your explanation. I was told by an authorized LG serviceman that this part no. Is used on all late model machines I.e. post 2004. The part you are asking about and I received in error is for older machines I.e. 2004 and earlier. I would check to be sure you are getting the correct part number. LG makes all these parts.

Good luck, my machine is now better than it was when new. I believe I had a defective part from the start.. Does 3485ED1002B is equivalent to 3485ED1002A? As a general rule, when the part numbers are identical except for the last letter, especially from an A to a B, the change of the last letter is to indicate that a newer version has been released. This is much the same as software programs that have updates that are sequentially numbered. This is my experience as a maintenence professional but you could check with a parts professional for insight.. Is this a replacement part for original? The original part has 10 electrical plug in and the replacement only has 9. I don't recall any open plugs.. Just ordered, does it fit the LG / LDF7932ST I would say probably.

Is there any way to get the doors to close tight? They pop back open and need to be manually closed. Had it checked out and the repairman couldn\\'t see anything wrong, including the leveling. Our installer told us the fridge had to be tipped slightly backwards to secure gravity assisted closure of the doors. Strictly level does not do it. Our installer was home depot who said they see this all the time. Our doors snap shut perfectly.. to confirm, the refrig will be delivered into the kitchen and debris removed? you need to pay for installation to have every thing installed and old fridge removed. shipping? how much for shipping. How about the dimensions please? Amazon, it\\'s CRUCIAL to list them. Here you go: 35 3/4\" x 70 1/4\" x 30 3/4\". i note these answers are from Goedeker but item is shown as shown by Urgent Liquidators. are they the same? I don\\'t see a question no Idea what you need . All I know is door bins all broke in under 1 yr and LG was Un-willng to be of any assistance. The design and construction is terrible. And new bins 5 at $50 ea. Make for a very expensive refer. how does shipping and delivery work, is it into the house or curbside? All amazon orders are white glove delivery. They will not install or remove, just uncrate the appliance purchased. Thank you. what is the width? 35 1/2\". ',\n",
       " \"Does this system filter gaillardia? I don't know and if you meant Giardia, I wouldn't trust it. I'd still boil the water from this filter for cooking and drink bottled water.. Want this to remove lime and other minerals from our hard water, so my car doesn't have spots! Will it work for this purpose? Thanks! This is a carbon filter to improve the taste of the water. If your water has high mineral content, you'll need a more comprehensive solution (water softener/reverse osmosis - hard to say at this point). In my area, I would talk to a local irrigation supply house - they can connect you with someone to test your water. Once you have that test, they can point you toward a solution. The solution all depends on your budget. The least cost option - don't wash you car in sun and dry it off with a towel.. how many gallons will the this filter filter? Off the top of my head I think it said 11000. But obviously depends on how bad the water.. Does it have replacable filters? No. how does it attach to garden hose? The filter is threaded on both ends. It's best to use quick connects to protect the plastic threads.. \",\n",
       " \"Is this item everpure h-300 compatible? Yes, it is. This is the second Omnipure I have purchased. It seems to function the same as the Everpure H-300.. Is this item ELF5M-P compatible? Yes, KDF identifies a filtration media within the filter. You can look up KDF on the web for further information.. I replaced my H300 filter with the Omnipure ELF-5M-KDF-P Carbon Block Filter, but I see particles floating that weren't there before. Is that normal? They should eventually go away. Your h300 is a .25 micronfilter. The elf-5m-kdf-p is 5 micron, it will allow much larger particles through. If they are white it may be calcium. Harmless go nack to the h300 much better filter. I also have a Hoshizaki 4HC-H large filter for my ice machine. Do sell these filters or another brand that would fit? Hello, please copy and paste this link. http://www.amazon.com/Compatible-9655-11-9326-11H-Replacement-BevGuard/dp/B00CUE0CPM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378092048&sr=8-1&keywords=bgh3200s+pavel. I have a body glove filter system in my restaurant that uses the body glove BG-3000S or BG-3000R &amp; ever pure H300 EV927200. Will this unit work? Elf fits where H300 filter fits just fine.. \",\n",
       " \"Is it removable? I would like to use it in my rental kitchen. The adhesive is pretty strong. If you were to try to remove this product, you would probably lift some of any underlying paint, depending on the quality and age of that paint. But, I don't think it would do any serious damage to the wall. I did a test piece on a wall with a decent paint job, and I was able to remove with no damage at all.. Hi. How are you? Can I put my refrigerator magnets on top of the film? Thank you. Hello. No, the film is still only paper, with a stainless steel look and no magnetic qualities.. can you use it on cabinets? Want to put it on old cabinets in heated garage I think it would peel off. Actually I used mi no to cover shutter louvers and it wouldn't stay. I believe the film is best suited for metallic surfaces.. Is this the satin stainless steel or the matte brushed nickel finish? satin. Can I use it on a fridge with curved edges? Depends on where the curves are. Mine has curves around the sides of the doors. And it did great.. Can it be used as a kitchen backsplash? If your backsplash is a few feet long it can. Mine is a little over 9 feet and I scrapped this material for 18 gauge stainless steel because of the difficulty of managing this thin material. The additional cost of SS sheet is worth the effort and cost.. Could this be used on the front of a dishwasher? I used it on my dishwasher. It worked pretty well.. Can you use this on the front of an oven, too? Is it heat resistant? I have put fairly hot items on my table without marringnor melting. I doubt that the front of an oven would get hot enough tp melt it.. My front doors have very small dents in them from kids beating on them with toys. Will this get rid of the dents without looking like bubbles? It might. I used this product over a textured finish on the side of my oven and it looks smooth.. How do you clean it? Do you use a stainless steel cleaner or just windex it? I just use windex. \",\n",
       " 'Is the vent considered to be a metal foil vent? Can\\'t use a foil vent with my dryer, manu. suggests a heavy metal vent, which are a pain to maneuver. The vent that comes with it is a metal foil vent. But you can attach it to a metal vent and attach the metal vent to your dryer. That\\'s what we\\'ve done.. How often does it need to be cleaned out? once a month. will this work well in a two car garage that is adequately vented with \\'whirly type\\' spinners in the roof? I think it would be fine in that environment.. I live in Fl. need to vent this in my garage with no ventilation. How much of a problem is this?? No outside ventilation required.... can this lint trap mounton the wall Yes it can. I have mine on the wall and it is great and it was very easy to mount.. Can this be used for a gas dryer?? Not sure due to the possibility of gas fumes needing to escape. Is there something online that says this product will meet code. My inspector is saying it does not meet code. Well I\\'m not sure about that. They are not the best idea to use indoors as there will be moisture which can cause mold. I\\'m using it as a cheap outdoor vent. Sliding the hose and lint trap out my sliding door on the deck ouside. If you use it indoors be sure to wipe down the moisture left behind. And clean the lint trap after every use.. Is there something online that I can print out from the manufacturer saying if meets code? My inspector is saying it won\\'t. Not sure, but I don\\'t think it meets code. I had to beg to Ge the best buy guys to install my dryer with it. They are afraid of liability if you should allow it to become depleted of water and use the dryer.., there may be a fire. What diameter hose fits on to the Lint Trap? I am hoping the standard 4\", as that is what the new dryer coming uses. Thanks Yes it is the standard size. Can this be mounted to the wall and can it be easily detached for cleaning Yes, it can. You need to drill a hole in the back in order to mount it on the wall, and obviously need enough clearance so you can add water to the base and clean the filter. Since all the lint gathers on the screen and then drops into the drawer below, this is what you need to be able to detach, not the whole unit. Although you did not ask, this is a wonderful product well worth the small investment. My previous dryer has a self-contained lint system, but my new one needed to be vented outside. I was afraid of animals getting in the venting, so I went to this model instead of outdoor venting. It has worked perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone.. ',\n",
       " 'What is the width of the insert? The width is 12\". The product dimensions are listed as 7 x 7 x 7 inches. Is this correct? If not, what are the actual dimensions? That is the outside dimension. It is not square but irregular to fit the dryer. It\\'s perfect match to existing filter.. does this replace whirlpool cabrio filter w10049360? I don\\'t know , we purchased for our Maytag, seems to be working fine.. Do you know if this is the proper replacement lint screen for a Whirlpool Duet Dryer Model No. WGD9470WW2? I do not have a \"Whirlpool Duet Dryer. I suspect that my dryer is the same as the Whirlpool. Only one or two companies make drers and they wind up all over with different names. I purchased this lint screen for my dryer. It does the job. I do not feel that it is as well made but as I said, It does the job. John. ',\n",
       " 'Is the filter dishwashable? I would not put in dishwasher. Soak is soapy water , light bristle brush, rinse and let air dry. Are these the aluminum filters or are these fabric or paper? If the latter, do they go underneath the aluminum ones that came with the hood? Thanks! They are the aluminum screens that replace the ones already on your hood.. size of these filter 14.25\" x 11.75\". what are exact dimensions? all the other postings have the exact dimensions. \"standard size\" doesn\\'t really help much. Dimensions: 11.3/4\" x 14-1/4\" x 3/8\". What size is this ? standard size.. ',\n",
       " \"Can it be run on an ordinary 15 amp circuit? Sure. It comes with standard plug.. Can this unit be attached to normal washer-line hoses, or will it only attach to a sink faucet? It uses the same plug, hoses, and drain as a standard washer.. Can I forgo the dry cycle and just wash clothes without using the dryer? Do you have to use the dry cycle every time you wash a load? The dry cycle and the prewash cycle are options that can be manually added to most wash settings, but they are not selected automatically and sport, hand wash, and wool settings will not allow the dry cycle. There are also a separate dry setting and refresh (quick dry) setting which do not go through the wash cycles.. I noticed it says that the shipping weight is 200 lbs, how hard is it to move into the house (is it bulky etc.) could you do it with one person? For average person no . Does not come whit rollers, I am a strong man and for me it is very hard to move it . As rules ,If you weight less than 200 lb don't expected to move it.. Does this unit have a way to vent it to the outside or is only a ventless unit. ventless only. Is this Machine Ventless? Yes, it is :). I only use cold water. Can I connect only the cold water hose to kitchen adapter? Yes but you need a y that connects to the hot water also. Or you can put a cap on the hot water side.. What is theWidth on this unit? 23 7/16 wide. I just got this washer. I want to know can you use bleach to wash white clothes in this machine. Yes. Does the washer come with hoses for water and drain? Three hoses? Thanks! Yes it does. \",\n",
       " 'Will the doors come off easily so we can fit it through a 30\" door? The doors do come off. Not sure how easily as they were removed by the delivery company to get the fridge up a flight of stairs. They were put back on with ease. FYI - the handles also come off the doors if that is an option - then you might not have to remove the door. Best of luck.. I just received mine and it seems to run a little loud...constantly humming...is this normal? Mine is a different sounding fridge, but not really louder, I believe it is mostly fan noise not compressor noise. But ... make sure that you have at least 2\" of air gap in the back. It is such a big unit it is tempting to push it back as far as you can. The better air flow you have over the back the less sound you hear.. The CFE29TSDSS is supposed to have hot water capability but the description does not mention it - is this the correct model? It does have hot water capability. 10 ounces @ 190F max. Not exactly ideal for black tea, but works for green tea, hot chocolate, and instant oatmeal. Mine is being delivered this week and I will post a review after I get a feel for it.. The dimensions are not very clear in this ad. The space I have available for my fridge is 69.75\" h x 36\" w and 30\"d or deeper. Will this fridge fit? The height dimensions are 69 and 7/8, so you might be tight on the height aspect. It\\'s also a very deep fridge, extending a couple of inches beyond my lower cabinets beside the fridge. Another thing that was problematic was the delivery. The fridge is so deep that it barely fit through the front door. It wasn\\'t the fridge depth so much, but on the left fridge door, the ice maker button extends out about another inch exceeding the dimensions of our front door. Fortunately the guys that delivered it were pretty expert, and completely took off the fridge door to get it in the house.. does the hot water dispenser lock to accidental prevent burns It takes so long to heat the water that an accidental mishap is extremely unlikely. We never use the feature as it is much faster to microwave the cup of water than wait. I checked it out just to verify it works and no one has used it since. If you don\\'t have a microwave than it is useful if you are a patient individual.. Is the side body panel stainless steel or black? It is black.. How long does it take to heat up the water in the hottest setting? 5 1/2 minutes. At first that felt like a long time. Now I love it - I simply occupy myself with something for that time and I am not microwaving my water.. is width 36\"? I have opening is 36 1/2\"/ does it fit in? If one side of the refrigerator is NOT adjacent to a wall, you should be ok. If it is, you will need more room. The unit is a few inches taller than my old fridge, so if you have overhead cabinets, you need to be aware of that, as well.. Does this have a hot water dispenser Yes. ',\n",
